description: open source as proprietary accessory

Today's public hand-wringing about privacy, security, and
user manipulation comes comically, pitiably late.  Software
people have long taken extra steps when using the big social
networks, from privacy settings to browser extensions to
throwaway addresses and Tor, that show what we know about
the industry.  But we also know all that's mostly theater.
We're tech people, but we might as well be plumbers,
insurance brokers, or grandma---in a word, marks---as far as
other devs' apps are concerned.  That's more and more true,
even as more and more software gets made with open source.

Open source software is _winning_.  Software freedom---the
power to be both developer and user of the apps that matter
in your life---is not.  If there were ever a short case for
a difference, there it is.

Many programmers believe that open source doesn't belong in
conversations about privacy protection, transparency, or
end-user choice.  They're right.  But open source chooses
not to belong.  Free software takes a stand on user-facing
issues.  Open source takes a stand on user-facing issues,
beyond the right to _be_ users, if and only if the users
happen to be programmers.

That makes open source a club.  Within the club, there's
relative peace, a more refined code of conduct, and
benefits---the mythified software commons.  Everyday
practices outside the club, like invasive ads and demanding
pay for work, are strongly discouraged inside the club.
But membership is extended exclusively to programmers.
Non-programmers benefit only by member invitation.
Invitations frequently cost money, privacy, or both.

That's why open source _wins_ today.  It wins, dilutely, as
accessory to proprietary software.  It's more efficient to
build proprietary code---social networks, marketplaces,
locked-in user communities---on open source freebies.  But
it's more profitable, so they say, to deny users of those
networks meaningful rights to patch, fork, and set policy.
Each app conspires against its own laity.

But isn't _all_ software these days really open source, or
heading that way?  After all, proprietary software is ever
more made of open source, and even _like_ open source, as
"innersource".  When we look at proprietary apps and
services from top to bottom, the layer of closed,
proprietary integration, application, and design code on top
of the stack---often open and common---measures relatively
thin.  At least technically speaking.

But that's a distinction falling conveniently short of a
difference.  I can improve [Facebook's framework][react],
making it easier to develop facebook.com, and drawing in
more developers Facebook might like to hire for the job.  I
can optimize [LinkedIn's database][kafka], making
linkedin.com cheaper to run, and fewer tickets for LinkedIn
staff to handle.  But Facebook isn't a front-end framework,
and LinkedIn isn't a database.

Not really.  Not even close.  Even if sloughing away all the
open source leaves but a thin film of proprietary code, that
code implements the choices that meaningfully affect users.
Patches to that layer, to the network itself, aren't
welcome.  Patching user-user and user-owner relationships is
network-owner prerogative.

Network-owner prerogative is a pervasive kind of power.
Networks are value propositions like any other, but network
owners work more like brokerage than retail.  Lots of
valuable users make a valuable network, and that value can
overwhelm the cost of an irksome or incompetent broker.
We'll abide a creepy social network to socialize with the
right people. We'll abide a slimy marketplace to buy the
rights product at the right price.  We'll abide social
networks and market makers who get linearly creepier and
slimier over time, if the network effects stack up
geometrically.

"Network effect" is Valley Speak, not a hacker term.  But
software freedom advocates bid consciously for network
effect in 1989, starting with GPL.  In specific domains, the
GPL still reigns.  It's easier to port GCC to your new
architecture than to write a compiler from scratch, even if
you think RMS is nuts.  It's easier to tweak WordPress than
to seed you own blog-platform community, even if copyleft
licenses give you migraines. The freedom-indifferent abide
GPL conditions and GPL politics for free code and
documentation all the time.  Even as old hands get nuttier
and license combinatorics explode.

That is exactly the promise of network power.  A free
software network affects not just the software that freedom
advocates write, but software that anyone writes, and
software freedom advocates end up having to run.  It affects
incentives for nearly anyone writing software in a domain
touched by the network, even managers openly hostile to
software freedom.
