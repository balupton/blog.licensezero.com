Some see the open source sustainability problem as a problem of getting companies to pay developers.  If I didn't know better, I'd say that sounds pretty easy.  Companies pay software developers lots of money all the time.

Consider data from the [Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/home.htm) for the US in 2016:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Occupation</th>
      <th>Median Pay</th>
      <th>Number of Jobs</th>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>Computer and Information Research Scientists</td>
      <td>$111,840</td>
      <td>27,900</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Computer Programmers</td>
      <td>$79,840</td>
      <td>294,900</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Computer Systems Analysts</td>
      <td>$87,220</td>
      <td>600,500</td>

      <td>$102,280</td>
      <td>1,256,200</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>

    </tr>
  </tbody>

As you might expect from those figures, the country is sprouting code schools like mushrooms.  A glut of eager students fill their cohorts, rushing to enter software-developer work and make software-developer money.

One model of open source sustainability holds that a company paying forty computer programmers to build proprietary software should hire, say, ten of the open source programmers churning out work they rely on.  Or should allow its forty programmers to spend a fifth of their time on open source.

In the wood-paneled, smokey back room of my mind where I role-play mid-level corporate management, I hear a retort:

> What do _I_ need to hear about "open source"?  That's engineering business.  If the engineers we're paying use open source to create value, that's part of the value we're paying them for.
>
> If you insist, sure, we can hire ten new open source developers.  We'll just have to pay the other forty less, to make the budget.

A contrarian narrative of financial sustenance for open source:  Companies are already paying the money open source needs.  They are paying it to programmers writing proprietary software.  Those programmers take the value of open source up to their employers, but don't pass financial support down to its authors.

This argument feels dangerous.  It has some very disturbing properties.

Objectively, it ignores non-financial benefits of employment or even stable contracting.  Large companies hiring open source developers give those developers a semblance of stability and predictability.  They'll receive some check each month, and may receive benefits.  There's also a certain reputational bonus, first from having been hired to do open source work, and second, perhaps, from having been hired by the company itself, if its reputation is good.

Giving open source developers those benefits could improve the open source they churn out.  Perhaps they'd be more responsive to bug reports.  More careful to code securely.  Quicker to take up new features.  Faster to patch as interconnected systems change.  The companies providing those benefits---and relying upon the open source software---might profit on the exchange.  [Or not.  It's complicated.](https://medium.com/@mikeal/great-post-8a4dfe7ee550)

Politically, it divides the community, and not in a happy way.  Rather than one, unitary community of open source contributors and potential open source contributors, it's givers and takers.  Setting aside those who give back in kind---proprietary developers who do open source off the clock---we know that we're left with many, many developers who take from open source, and build proprietary software, without so much as giving beer money.  Dark picture.

If we take compensating value delivered, or giving as one has received, as a _moral_ prescription, it makes perfect sense to leave moral obligations with people, rather than corporations.  We don't expect corporations to reciprocate gifts, to balance out windfalls, to greet good fortune with commensurate selfless generosity.  The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, not Microsoft, kills the mosquitos, pays off debts, writes schooling standards.  The Ford Foundation, not Ford Motor, funds [seminal work on open source sustainability](https://www.fordfoundation.org/library/reports-and-studies/roads-and-bridges-the-unseen-labor-behind-our-digital-infrastructure/).  Rockefeller, not Standard Oil.  Howard Hughes Medical Institute, not Hughes Aircraft.

All the sudden, patronage makes sense.  Patreon accounts for highly reputed open source developers, funded by small-dollar donations from other developers, let paid developers prop up the unpaid devs they rely on.
