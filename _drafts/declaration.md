We hold these truths of open software development to be self-evident:

- that all software is valuable, be it complete applications, components of other applications, or development tools

- the overwhelming majority of businesses will give back only what they are obligated to give back, no more or less

- individuals and small businesses licensing on permissive terms like MIT, BSD, and Apache 2.0 invite inequity

- business plans that charge for something other than open software and open software development aren't open software sustainability plans
