Two new licensing ideas, two new licensing dramas.  [Commons Clause](https://commonsclause.org) patches existing open source licenses, limiting commercial use and resale.  [Lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna/blob/19a7f5d4bd88b9cc50b603adcf171623227ec554/LICENSE) added a preamble to their license to prevent it applying to a list of companies contracting for US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, then reverted the change amid protest.

As terms, Commons Clause and Lerna-style exclusions fill small niches, and matter little in the grand scheme.  Many companies fork their own open projects, continuing development as proprietary software.  But relatively few of those continue developing in the open, or want to allow the specific, narrow kind of free commercial use that Commons Clause permits.  Corporate bad behavior offends many a conscience.  But relatively few developers will pick that battle in `LICENSE`.

As lessons in open source politics, however, both Commons Clause and Lerna teach a great deal.  What they teach is deeply disturbing.  They plot new data points on developing trend lines:

1. As a rule, open source activists perceive more threat from licensing and development approaches close to, but not the same as, open source orthodoxy than from closed and proprietary software.  Make proprietary software with open source, the community will honor your choice.  Offer open source terms, but not to everyone, or offer slightly less than open source terms, and the pious will flood your social media with scorn.
2. Incorrect legal statements, flawed legal reasoning, and the imputed legal soundness of foundation-blessed policy positions create fear, uncertainty, and doubt in innovating developers without lawyers of their own.  The bombardment leaves a false impression of the law that's often the inverse of actual policy.

Anyone trying something new in the community should anticipate heat.  Both Commons Clause and Lerna could have done a great deal more to minimize confusion and drama.

# Developers can license their code as they like.

In the pull request reverting the change to Lerna's license, [a maintainer writes](https://github.com/lerna/lerna/pull/1633):

> First, I apologize for making the rash decision to support the addition of an unenforceable clause to the project's MIT license.

A couple things are unclear: how the maintainer came to the conclusion that the change was "unenforceable", and how they were supposed to know better.
