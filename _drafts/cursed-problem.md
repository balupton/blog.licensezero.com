title: Sustainability as Cursed Problem
description: learning to learn from game development

License Zero came about by looking _outside_ software to other fields and industries, and accepting that none of open software's problems apply only to software.  Public-private licensing, the model License Zero facilitates, is common and accepted in photography, B-roll, and other creative media, while it's often ignored or downplayed in software.

Most recently, I've been reading up on fairness, funding, and opportunity issues in game development, especially computer game development.  It's an interesting meeting point between older media, like art, music, and film, and often quite sophisticated software development.  If the music and film industries orbit Los Angeles, and software calls the Bay Area home, computer gaming is a dual citizen, drawing opportunistically from both.  As usual, monocultures have a lot to learn from their hybrids.

This line of research recently led me to Alex Jaffe's talk ["Cursed Problems in Game Design"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uE6-vIi1rQ) at the Game Developers Conference in 2019.  The crux of Alex' talk is the notion of cursed problems: unsolvable design problems rooted in conflicts between promises games make to their players, or in other words, conflicting expectations gamers bring to games.  Alex develops an extended example of a multiplayer video game combining [beat 'em up]([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beat_%27em_up](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beat_'em_up)) and [competitive fighting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fighting_game) elements, with many combatants on-screen, but each controlled by a human player.  Players love roughing up throngs of on-screen baddies, and eventually beating the game.  They also love mastering the complex movements, strategies, and combinations of competitive fighting games.  Unfortunately, mashing the two together yields less than the sum of the parts.  Mastering fighting mechanics makes players more effective individually.  But in practice, teaming up on stronger players, rather than maximizing individual skills, yields the most victories.  The game becomes an exercise in group politics, rather than a contest of solo virtuosity.  By a kind of tall-poppy syndrome, skill actually summons swift punishment.

Alex encourages designers facing cursed problems to accept that their roots go right to the expectations of their players.  Cursed problems therefore cannot be solved without modifying---compromising---one or more kinds of value players hope to take from the game.  So designers can make frustrating player behavior impossible, by removing game mechanics.  They can make use of game mechanics to frustrate player expectations more difficult.  They can reward play styles that fulfill player expectations, without changing mechanics.  Or they can embrace confounding play styles as happy accidents, and make them the heart of the game.  Rather than simply hobbling a game, such compromises often markedly improve the play experience overall.

Nearly every week, I find a new reason to be grateful that software has an acknowledged "sustainability" issue.  Our new, shared vocabulary of the problem---ecology, infrastructure---enable recognition and discussion in new and increasingly urgent ways.  Having been given a way to talk about the problem, we can see the problem in the first place.

But nearly as often as I'm grateful, I'm frustrated by how the metaphors of sustainability welcomed by users both implicitly and explicitly dehumanize producers.  Software developers aren't forests, highway systems, fisheries, or water systems.  Trees, roads, bridges, fish, and water aren't people.  We don't tend to think of ecological, infrastructure maintenance, or man-versus-nature problems first and foremost as people problems.

Conversations in such flawed terms do far more good than no conversations at all.  But the latent error reinforces wrong thinking, wrong behavior, and wrong answers.  And it sows feelings of insult and unease, much as calling staff "human resources" tends to widen rifts within organizations.  The usual meanings of "resources"---computers, parts, machinery, dollars---aren't people.  Management sets itself up as callous and aloof deploying forcing the word for printer cartridges on team members.

Framing open software development as a game recognizes the humanity of players on all sides.  Seen as a game, does open software have a cursed problem?

It's easy to identify broadly held expectations on both sides at fundamental odds.  Open source consumers want ample code, maintenance, and support for nothing.  Producers want advancement, opportunity, and compensation for their work.  Consumers want friction-free discovery, distribution, and integration.  Producers want credit, recognition, and reputation.  Consumers want state-of-the-art code under open terms.  Producers need especially free and stable work environments to do their best work.  And so on.

Some of these conflicts can be theorized away by dissolving all distinction between producer and consumer, assuming that every producer losing in one round will be the consumer winning in another, the game thus balancing itself out over enough successive plays.  But that hypothesis falls down in practice.  Chains of supply from low level to high level to application to end user remain unidirectional, not circular.  Going one steps further and presupposing that every player is, or ought to be, part of such an enterprise---working for a proprietary software or service shop, or for one of their suppliers---helps to avoid that error, if only by assuming still more.  It fails to account for enterprises whose customers are other developers, like the database companies involved in so many controversies of late.  It also conflicts insolubly with the idealism of software freedom for end users, and saps the motivation of idealists to contribute more code.
