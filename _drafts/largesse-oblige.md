Some see the open source sustainability problem as a problem of getting companies to pay developers.  If I didn't know better, I'd say that sounds pretty easy.  Companies pay software developers lots of money all the time.

Consider data from the [Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/home.htm) for the US in 2016:

As you might expect from those figures, the country is sprouting code schools like mushrooms.  A glut of eager students fill their cohorts, rushing to enter software-developer work and make software-developer money.  I've met gaggles of these people, mentoring at [NodeSchool events](https://nodeschool.io).

One model of open source sustainability holds that a company paying forty computer programmers to build proprietary software should hire, say, ten of the open source programmers churning out work they rely on.  Or should allow its forty programmers to spend a fifth of their time on open source.

In the smokey, wood-paneled back room of my mind where I role-play mid-level management, I hear a retort:

> What do _I_ need to hear about "open source"?  That's engineering business.  If the engineers we're paying use open source to create value, that's part of the value we're paying them for.
>
> You insist?  Well, sure!  We can hire ten new open source developers.  We'll just pay the other forty less, to make the budget.

A contrarian narrative of financial sustenance for open source:  Companies are already paying out the money open source needs.  They are paying it to programmers writing proprietary software.  Those programmers take the value of open source up to their employers, but don't pass their employers' financial support down to its authors.

This argument feels dangerous.  It has some very disturbing properties.

It ignores non-financial benefits of employment or even stable contracting.  Large companies hiring open source developers give those developers a semblance of stability and predictability.  They'll receive some check each month, and may receive benefits.  There's also a certain reputational bonus, first from having been hired to do open source work, and second, perhaps, from having been hired by the company itself, if its reputation is good.

Giving open source developers those benefits could improve the open source they churn out.  Perhaps they'd be more responsive to bug reports.  More careful to code securely.  Quicker to take up new features.  Faster to patch as interconnected systems change.  The companies providing those benefits---and relying upon the open source software---might profit by the exchange.  [Or not.  It's complicated.](https://medium.com/@mikeal/great-post-8a4dfe7ee550)

Politically, it divides the community, and not in a happy way.  Rather than one, unitary community of open source contributors and potential open source contributors, it's givers and it's takers.  Pardoning those who give back in kind---proprietary developers who do open source off the clock---we know we're still left with many, many developers who take from open source, and build proprietary software, without so much as picking up a beer tab.  Meanwhile, what solidarity do the unpaid have with the paid, to drive a harder bargain with employers?  Dark picture.

But if we take compensating value delivered, or giving as one has received, as a _moral_ prescription, it makes perfect sense to leave moral obligations with people, rather than corporations.  We don't expect corporations to reciprocate gifts, to balance out windfalls, to greet good fortune with commensurate, selfless generosity.  The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, not Microsoft, kills the mosquitoes, pays off the debts, writes the curriculum standards.  The Ford Foundation, not Ford Motor, [supports seminal work on open source sustainability](https://www.fordfoundation.org/library/reports-and-studies/roads-and-bridges-the-unseen-labor-behind-our-digital-infrastructure/).  Rockefeller, not Standard Oil.  Howard Hughes Medical Institute, not Hughes Aircraft.

All the sudden, patronage makes sense.  [Patreon](https://patreon.com) accounts for highly reputed open source developers, funded by small-dollar donations from other developers, let paid developers prop up the unpaid devs they rely on.  [Sell a private mailing list and early security bulletins.](https://www.patreon.com/eranhammer)  It's the in-house dev's neck if there's a problem, a missed deadline, or a breach.  [Sell laptop stickers.](https://www.patreon.com/feross)  Suits don't use those.  Coders do.  [Sell ads to corporations if you can](https://www.patreon.com/mafintosh), especially [for large amounts](https://www.patreon.com/evanyou).  But mostly, focus on driving the largest number of small-contributors to your page that you can.  Lowering friction in volume is the only way the high fees make sense.

All the sudden, unified reputation systems, like [GitHub activity](https://help.github.com/articles/why-are-my-contributions-not-showing-up-on-my-profile/), make sense.  (And so does gaming them.)  Fellow shows up in your repos issues, asking for feature.  Is he in your patrons list?  No.  Is he active in open source?  No.  Give him his choice:  Show me commits, or show me coin.  Otherwise, I'll show you `#wontfix`.  [I don't need to know who you're working for.](https://blog.licensezero.com/2017/10/16/mercenary-rapport.html).  This is between you and me.

This view comports nicely with open source, especially permissively licensed open source, as mere adjunct to proprietary software development.  In essence, open source becomes a performance enhancer for developers of complete proprietary products and services.  Things people, other than programmers, interact with and derive value from.  More and more free software gets written, but it keeps getting harder and harder to make do without proprietary apps and services.

A single, additional ray of hope shines through:  Open source developers can now trade on reputation developed within open source development for cash, while remaining within open source.  They don't have to write proprietary code to pay rent.  But the cash they earn flows predominantly through proprietary enterprises, and the occasional large-scale open-source [service](https://ws02.com) or [hosting](https://discourse.org) play.
