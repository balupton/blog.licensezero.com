Some see "open source sustainability" as a problem of getting companies to pay the devs.  If I didn't know better, I'd say that sounds pretty easy.  Companies pay software developers lots of money all the time.

Consider data from the [Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/home.htm) for the US in 2016:

As you might expect from those figures, the country is sprouting code schools like mushrooms.  A glut of eager students fill their cohorts, rushing to enter software-developer work and make software-developer money.  I've met gaggles of these people mentoring at [NodeSchool](https://nodeschool.io).  Enter [freeCodeCamp](http://freecodecamp.com/).

One model of open source sustainability holds that a company paying forty computer programmers to build proprietary software should hire, say, ten of the open source programmers turning out work they rely on.  Or should allow its forty programmers to spend a fifth of their time on open source.

From the smokey, wood-paneled back room of my mind, where I role-play an ambitious, mid-level manager, a growl:

> What do _I_ need to hear about "open source"?  That's engineering business.  If the engineers we're paying use open source to create value and get away with it, that's part of the value we're paying them for.
>
> You insist?  Well, sure!  We can hire ten new open source developers.  We'll just pay the other forty less, to make the budget.

A contrarian narrative of financial sustenance for open source:  Companies are already paying out the money open source needs.  They are paying it to programmers writing proprietary software.  Those programmers take the value of open source up to their employers, but don't pass their employers' financial support down.

# Uh-Oh

This argument feels dangerous.  It has some very disturbing properties.

It ignores non-financial benefits of employment or even stable contracting.  Large companies hiring open source developers give those developers a semblance of stability and predictability.  They'll receive some check each month, and may receive benefits.  There's also a certain reputational bonus, first from having been hired to do open source work, and second, perhaps, from having been hired by the company itself, if its reputation is good.

Giving open source developers those benefits could improve the open source they churn out.  Perhaps they'd be more responsive to bug reports.  More careful to code securely.  Quicker to take up new features.  Faster to patch as interconnected systems change.  The companies providing those benefits---and relying upon the open source software---might profit by the exchange.  [Or not.  It's complicated.](https://medium.com/@mikeal/great-post-8a4dfe7ee550)

Politically, it divides the community, and not in a happy way.  Rather than one, unitary trade of open source contributors present and potential, it's givers and it's takers.  Pardoning those who give back in kind---proprietary developers who do open source off the clock---we know we're still left with many, many developers who use open source to build proprietary software without so much as picking up a beer tab.  Meanwhile, what solidarity do the unpaid have with the paid, to drive a harder bargain with employers?  Dark picture.

But if we take compensating value delivered, or giving as one has received, as a _moral_ prescription, it makes perfect sense to leave that obligation with people, rather than corporations.  Start with a collective action challenge, like funding public goods, and add corporate structure.  Now you have _two_ collective action challenges, one tied up with the other.  So we don't expect corporations to reciprocate gifts, to balance out windfalls, to greet good fortune with commensurate, selfless generosity.  We expect them to make security holders rich.

The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, not Microsoft, kills the mosquitoes, pays off the debts, writes the curriculum standards.  The Ford Foundation, not Ford Motor, [supports seminal work on open source and its problems](https://www.fordfoundation.org/library/reports-and-studies/roads-and-bridges-the-unseen-labor-behind-our-digital-infrastructure/).  Rockefeller, not Standard Oil.  Howard Hughes Medical Institute, not Hughes Aircraft.  Personal vehicles with tax advantages that hemorrhage personal wealth.  It's a pattern.

All of a sudden, patronage makes sense.  [Patreon](https://patreon.com) accounts for highly reputed open source developers, funded by small-dollar donations from other developers, let the paid prop up the unpaid they rely on.  [Sell a private mailing list and timely access to security bulletins.](https://www.patreon.com/eranhammer)  It's the in-house dev's neck if there's a problem, a missed deadline, or a breach.  [Sell laptop stickers.](https://www.patreon.com/feross)  Suits don't use those.  Coders do.  [Sell ads to corporations if you can](https://www.patreon.com/mafintosh), sure.  Especially [for large amounts](https://www.patreon.com/evanyou).  But mostly, focus on driving as many small-dollar, fellow-dev contributors to your page as you can.  Low friction, for aggregate volumes of dollars you otherwise wouldn't see, is the only way the high fees make sense.  [Become a cactus, if that's what the Internet wants.](https://patreon.com/typicode)

And wouldn't you know, unified reputation systems, like [GitHub activity](https://help.github.com/articles/why-are-my-contributions-not-showing-up-on-my-profile/), also make sense.  So does gaming them.  Fellow shows up in your repos issues, asking for feature.  Is he on your patrons list?  No.  Is he active in open source?  No.  Give him his choice:  Show me commits, or show me coin, or I'll show you `#wontfix`.  [I don't need to know who you're working for.](https://blog.licensezero.com/2017/10/16/mercenary-rapport.html).  This is between you and me.

Basically, it's the coins from [John Wick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wick_(film_series)).  Give a favor, take a favor, end up rich in favors, solvent, or dead to the guild.  But instead of murder for hire, it's the dirty work of rigging up software that straight folk don't need to see.

[The whole thing makes me queasy.](https://twitter.com/kemitchell/status/937720688462278657)  [It all seems a bit absurd.](https://twitter.com/kemitchell/status/946929942633345024)

This view comports nicely with open source as mere adjunct to proprietary software development, especially permissively licensed open source.  In essence, open source becomes a performance enhancer for developers of complete proprietary products and services.  Things people other than programmers interact with and derive value from.  <!--TODO: link blog post-->More and more free software gets written, but it keeps getting harder and harder to make do without proprietary apps and services.

A single, additional ray of hope shines through:  Open source developers can trade on reputation developed within open source development for cash, while remaining within open source.  They don't have to write proprietary code to pay rent.  They can stay pure, to an extent.  But the cash they earn flows down from proprietary enterprises, like water down from a mountain snow cap.  There are glorious, glorious exceptions, like [service](https://ws02.com) and [hosting](https://discourse.org).  But the thrust of industry is proprietary services, even if all that's proprietary in those services is [application-specific, brackish residue that can't be so easily abstracted away](https://github.com/substack/blog/blame/9d89edcd55b7424d8c0f65d5c0dfd2dec34993c0/module_steps.markdown#L75).

In this world, under this new norm, License Zero still has work to do in making open source competitively viable.  Open source companies can reap [L0-R](https://licensezero.com/licenses/reciprocal) software for free, while proprietary shops pay its price.

The system could restructure toward developer-to-developer licenses easily enough, with companies licensed if the developers they're paying are.  Even smaller transactions.  One per developer, perhaps.  Everyone on the web team pays for a private license for the framework, rather than sharing a private license in the name of the company.  Mere implementation details.

# SOS

I know the open source party line.  I can quote Lessig, channel Raymond, and cite the GPL in several versions.  And I suppose I could make a career, of sorts, articulating and refining the now orthodox counter-economy, commons-utopian gestalt of open source, née free software.  A trusty steward's modest duty.

I'm not cut out for it.  I wouldn't consider myself truly paid forward if didn't go hunting for contrary views, and put them to the test.  I'm not the marketing department.  I'm here to hunt bugs, find exploits, and patch them.  Open source has plenty of cheerleaders.  Maybe too many.

That's not to say I don't root for the team.  If the point of view presented here irks you, well, it irks me, too.  Help me argue it down, consistently and rigorously.

So far, I can't shake it.
