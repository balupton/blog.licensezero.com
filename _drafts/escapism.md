In [_Diglossia_](https://blog.licensezero.com/2019/04/18/diglossia.html) I observed a pattern in speaking and writing about open software, and hypothesized a psychological underpinning for it:

> [P]eople differ in their tolerance, and desire, for life in two spheres.
>
> Some want nothing more than a stable day job to finance freedom during nights, weekends, and off time. ...
>
> Some have to make art the whole of life. ...
>
> Two competing psychological needs, attempting to occupy the same linguistic space.  One seeks to keep the line between business and community sharp, the other to blur and erase it.  Some want money out of open source, to avoid "working" its vibe, while others rail against the anti-money allergy, because itâ€™s holding them down.

In that post, I mentioned that while I'd usually be too uncomfortable with support that generalistic and intuitive to publish it, I saw some outside verification in correlation between the backgrounds of my law colleagues and their views on the subject of paying open software developers.

I looked right past a manifestation _within_ open software itself: diametric _feelings_ about codes of conduct.

For someone receiving peculiar or disproportionate abuse on account of some personal or social factor, codes of conduct are a clear, perhaps essential, benefit.  Even if enforcement is lacking.  Even if the rules aren't that clear.  Even if the overall effect, seen objectively, is merely signaling those most likely to unintentionally or maliciously hold down to stay out.  Any improvement must be welcome.

All in, I think longer strides have been made in that direction through organizations, even large for-profit companies, than within informal, unstructured collaborations and associations, like open software projects.  Transitioning from an organizational setting with policy, enforcement, and even legal protections to one utterly without has to be jarring and stressful.  As more and more people do open software as part of their work for such organizations, the natural next step is to extend the protections of the work environment out into open software, where some of that work is being done.

Zero Order:  seeking out projects led by folks known to be sympathetic, supportive, and willing to take protective and corrective action

First Order:  adopting a written code of conduct

Second Order: meta-initiatives like [Tall Poppy](https://tallpoppy.io/), which packages anti-harassment training, protection, and mitigation as an employee benefit

Setting aside the effectiveness of these measures, they will be welcomed by many who don't feel welcomed by open source.  That welcome will extend to experiments with unproven and perhaps doubtful new terms, approaches, signals, and services.  Even when they don't go well, they'll be taken and appreciated as well meaning, from that point of view.

They will be unwelcome, rejected, and suspected by those from a different point of view, precisely for projecting into open software the policies, styles, controls, and formalisms of the working world.  Even by some who otherwise strongly support the _purpose_ of the impositions.  Even to the extent of leaving some feeling split, heart and mind, for reasons they may or may not be able to explain.
