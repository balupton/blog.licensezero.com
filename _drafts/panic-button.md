title: The Panic Button

Why work on licenses, business models, all the jazz that comes close to "do what you want on me", but not quite?

Communication.  Reality.

For some fucked up reason I still don't fully understand, devs and companies can't say what they mean without lawyers like me to bless and translate.  Without coders like me.  Without operators like me.

As developers---frankly, as people---we are all utterly capable of not just dehumanizing, but ignoring the human existence of people whose work we depend on.  Well all know this from day-to-day life.  How convinced are you that your shoes and shirts were entirely free labor?

We know it, more intimately than than, because others rely on our work, too, and elide our personal part in it.  In tech, most people who depend on our work are utterly, consistently blind to our existence.  They don't know who we are.  They don't know where we live.  They don't know if we're rich or poor, ten kids or alone, striving to make a name, paying the bills, or in it strictly for the dopamine, not knowing what else to do.  They interact with us, when they have problems, and then we disappear again.  We cease to exist in their world.

Of course, that isn't entirely the end of it.  They know _someone_, some person, has to be behind the work they leverage.  Code, chips, and standards don't make themselves.

We can get there by logical deduction, but that requires us to bother deducting.  Mostly, we don't.  So there's a big, convenient logical hole in our world views, for the personal rather than material dimensions of our dependencies, which we can only fill in with serious, strenuous, highly reflective feats of empathy and imagination.  That's a lot of work, and mostly, we don't bother.  Often, under strain, we simply can't, or so we believ.

What's more, when we do spare a thought for those whose work we depend on, we imagine that all is well with them.  Actually, we tend to lead on that they must be killing it: rich, famous, beloved, secure.  That is our moral happy path---for our conscience, not their reality.  It's a pleasing thought, but not an accountable one.

Morality comes in to shield us from answers we suspect to the questions we don't ask.  If they couldn't make all this work available for nothing, they wouldn't give all they've given!  So we think, self-servingly.  If they put this out there when they shouldn't have!  Fuck 'em!  They'll learn.  It's on them to ignore all the fleeting praise they receive.  Praise they can't eat, live in, or use to buy what they need from others.

A grim picture.  But better not to mention it too loudly.  Because the first thing they'll do, if they wise up, is take the freebies away, or simply call it quits.  They'll stop maintaining the code.  They'll bother with only _their_ bugs and features.  They'll charge for maintenance, support, docs, whatever.  And that's not good for us.  So hush.

Reality: Technology isn't an exclusive guild product of landed nerd gentry of no worldly concern.  The stacks we stand on, as a rule, aren't the products of listless aristocrats and superfluous men, drawn to computers, advancing the state of the art for lack of means to fill the idleness of their endless, luxurious days. 

Developers in the real world need panic buttons.

One of those panic buttons says "Rumors of my fame and fortunate have been grossly exaggerated.  Resources for time and attention to my work haven't been appropriately routed."  That message might need be sent reflectively, about existing work, or prospectively, about new work, depending on how it's packaged.  [Parity](https://paritylicense.com), [Prosperity](https://prosperitylicense.com), and [License Zero](https://licensezero.com) more generally give structure to that message and its consequences.

Another panic button says "All this evidence you're doing terrible, reprehensible things with my work is killing my motive to lift a finger on this project."  The intrinsic motivation we all assume takes "open" work out of the whole rubric of risk, reward, and economics gets many a project started, but experience sends them crashing back to Earth.  Users ought to know when their moral and social compromises catch up to them.  There ought to be a way to tell them.
