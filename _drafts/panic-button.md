Why work on licenses, business models, all the jazz that gets close to completely "do what you want, on me", but not quite?

Communication.  Reality.

For some fucked up reason I still don't fully understand, devs and companies can't say what they mean without lawyers like me to bless or translate.  Without coders like me.  Without operators like me.

As developers---frankly, as people---we are all utterly capable of not just dehumanizing, but ignoring the human existence of people whose work we depend on.  We all know this, because others rely on our work, too.  Most people who depend on _us_ are utterly, consistently blind to the fact we exist.  They don't know who we are.  They don't know where we live.  They don't know if we're rich or poor, with kids or alone, striving to make a name in it strictly for the dopamine and not knowing what else to do.  They interact with us when they have problems, and then they disappear.  We cease to exist in their world again.

Of course, that isn't entirely the end of it.  They know _someone_, some person, has to be behind the work they need.  Code, chips, and standards don't make themselves.  We can get there by logical deduction, but that requires us to bother deducting.  Mostly, we don't.  So there's a big, convenient logical hole in our world views, which we can only fill in with serious, strenuous, highly reflective bouts of empathy and imagination.  That's a lot of work, and mostly, we don't bother.  Often, under strain, we simply can't bother.

What's more, when we imagine those whose work we depend on, we imagine that all is well with them.  Actually, we tend to tell ourselves they must be killing it: rich, famous, beloved, secure.  That is our happy path---for our conscience, not their reality.

If they couldn't make all this work available for nothing, they wouldn't give all they've given, we think, self-servingly.  If they put this out there when they shouldn't have, fuck 'em.  They'll learn.  It's on them to learn not to trust all the praise they receive.  Praise they can't eat, live in, or use to buy the services of others.

A grim picture.  Better not to mention it.  Because the first thing they'll do, if they wise up, is take the freebies away, or simply call it quits.  They'll stop maintaining the code.  They'll close only _their_ bugs and features.  They'll charge for maintenance, support, features, whatever.  And that's not good for us.

Technology isn't an exclusive guild product of landed gentry with no worldly concern.  The stacks we stand on, as a rule, aren't the products of listless aristocrats and superfluous men, advancing the state of the art for lack of means to fill the luxurious idleness of their days.
