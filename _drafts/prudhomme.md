The storied old parties of open software love to tell half-true lies about each other.

The Free Software Party says Open Source strips Free Software of its values, sucking up to the nonfree software industry with promises of practical moneymaking benefits, for cash and acclaim.

The Open Source Party says Free Software isn't really any different from Open Source, but preached too much fire and brimstone, missed the rebrand, and lost out.

<!--You'll hear variations on these points repeatedly from each side.  But you won't hear Free Software partisans pushing the Open Source line, or Open Source partisans pushing the Fee Software line.-->

You don't have to toe either line.  And you can still have plenty to say about the broader importance of software in the modern world.

Many prolific open software developers do.  When they speak, they speak not as impassioned activists or utilitarian businesspeople, but as artisans answering a calling, as craftspeople who see their work as a duty, as righteous artificers.  Like them, you may believe that open is good because open makes software better, and software ought to be good.  You might look with disgust on closed software, and accept it only begrudgingly, because it's less good than it should be, you and your kind can make it better, but won't get the chance.

If so, you are not alone.  But you are not represented.

# Either-Org

For folks not feeling either major, historical open-software party strongly, the result, socially and politically, looks like a stark moral choice.  Become a rabid Free Software fundamentalist, install Utoto, shut off JavaScript, and start lecturing your friends and family.  Or become a busy Open Source drone-bee, land an enterprise gig or ten, pillage hapless non-techies, and buy something nice for your mid-life crisis.  You needn't feel bad about either choice.  Just be sure to keep company of your kind.  That's particularly easy at work, at partisan conferences, and in friendly corners of the Web.

"None of the Above" is also a popular option.  Find out where the partisans loiter, avoid them, keep coding, and dodge loaded questions.  Pack some pain pills, and keep your head down.  If you find yourself under ambush, do your best blank-slate impression, and let them talk themself out.  Nod your head until you can go back to work.

The Good News: The forever flame of the free-or-open debate can burn right along without you.

The Bad News: You will suffer decision without representation, over and over again.  The major parties are fully engaged and well represented in all the major institutions, from foundations to companies to consensus-constructed working groups.  You aren't.

Name a community institution speaking up for developers of open software against demanding users building lousy proprietary software?  I wish I could.  Name a community institution promoting, developing, and safeguarding models for small businesses that want to do pure open work?  I don't know of one.  Name a community marshaling legal talent to make tools and answer questions for developers who want their work to stay open without political fuss?  There isn't one.  Name an institution publishing standards and inspiration for higher calibers of aesthetic, architectural, and poetic achievement in software, rather than company-pleasing "maintainer do" best-practices checklists?  suckless.org, fifteen years ago?

# Both-Either

I know more than a few righteous artificers.  Many stay apprised of serious politics, and know their way around a collective action problem.  What accounts for their lack of representation?

Those who believe good software is _right_, bad software is _wrong_, and open makes software better can get recognition for a bit of their worldview from each incumbent party.  From Free Software they can take confirmation for a moral dissatisfaction with nonfree software, and a desire to compete with and replace it.  With Open Source they can share emphasis on quality and process, and respect for software's role as a tool or means to real-world ends.  Those bits, taken together, corroborate something close to the whole artificer position.

The trouble is they do not come together.  They coincide with other views artificers don't hold.  The artificer therefore learns to subsist on half-measures: the right tool, optimized for the wrong purpose, inevitably ill-suited in particular circumstances.  Some artificers use copyleft licenses like GPL to keep their work open, even though those licenses [preach lots they don't believe in](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html#preamble), and [work only half well for getting patches back](https://writing.kemitchell.com/2018/08/28/Unhappy-Coincidences.html#software-freedom-doesnt-mean-patches-back).  Some artificers use pared-down permissive licenses to avoid the hassle of GPL compliance,
