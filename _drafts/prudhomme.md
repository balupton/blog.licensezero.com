The old parties of open software love to tell half-true lies about each other.

The Free Software Party says Open Source strips Free Software of its values, sucking up to the nonfree software industry with promises of cheaper code, for cash and acclaim.

The Open Source Party says Free Software isn't really any different from Open Source, but preached too much fire and brimstone, missed the rebrand, and lost out.

You don't have to toe either line.  And you can still have plenty to say about the broader importance of software in the modern world.

Many prolific open software developers do.  When they up, they speak not as impassioned social activists or margin-hunting businesspeople, but as artisans answering a calling, as craftspeople who see their work as a duty, as upright artificers uphold high standards.  Like them, you may believe that open is good because open makes software better, and software ought to be good.  You might look with disgust on closed software, and accept it only begrudgingly, because it's less good than it should be, and you could make it better, but won't get the chance.

If so, you are not alone.  But you are not represented.

# Either-Org

For folks not feeling either major open-software party strongly, the result, socially and politically, looks like a stark moral choice.  Become a rabid Free Software fundamentalist, install Utoto, shut off JavaScript, and start lecturing your friends and family.  Or become a busy Open Source drone-bee, land an enterprise gig or ten, pillage hapless non-techies, and buy something nice for your mid-life crisis.  You needn't feel bad about either choice.  Just be sure to keep company of your kind.  That's easy at work, at partisan conferences, and in friendly corners of the Web.

"None of the Above" is also a popular option.  Find out where the partisans loiter, avoid them, and keep coding.  If you find yourself stuck in an ideological ambush, do your best blank-slate impression, and let them talk themselves out.  Nod your head until they let you get back to work.

The Good News: The forever flame of the free-or-open debate can burn right along without you.

The Bad News: You will suffer decision without representation, over and over again.  The major parties are fully engaged and well represented in all the major institutions, from foundations to companies to consensus-constructed working groups.  You aren't.

Name a community institution speaking up for developers of permissively licensed software against demanding users building lousy proprietary software?  I wish I could.  Name a community institution promoting, developing, and safeguarding models for small businesses that want to do pure open work?  I don't know of one.  Name a community marshaling legal talent to make tools and answer questions for keeping work open, without political fuss?  There isn't one.  Name an institution publishing standards and inspiration for greater aesthetic, architectural, and poetic achievement in software, rather than company-pleasing "maintainer do" best-practices checklists?  suckless.org, fifteen years ago?

# Both-Either

I know more than a few upright software artificers.  Many stay apprised of serious politics, and know their way around a collective action problem.  What accounts for their lack of representation?

Those who believe good software is _right_, that bad software is _wrong_, and that open makes software better can get recognition for a bit of their view from each incumbent party.  From Free Software they can take confirmation for a moral dissatisfaction with nonfree software, and a desire to compete with and replace it.  Open Source corroborates the importance of quality and process, and respect for software's role as a tool or means to real-world ends.  Those bits, taken together, add up to something near to the whole artificer outlook.

Trouble is, they never come as a package.  Rather, they come piecemeal, packaged with other views artificers don't share.  Some use copyleft licenses like GPL to keep their work open, even though those licenses [preach lots they don't believe in](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html#preamble), [work only half well for getting patches back](https://writing.kemitchell.com/2018/08/28/Unhappy-Coincidences.html#software-freedom-doesnt-mean-patches-back), and [come deliberately crippled with loopholes](https://blog.licensezero.com/2018/09/14/free-to-take-freedom.html).  Some artificers use pared-down permissive licenses to avoid the hassle of GPL compliance, [shooting their companies in the feet]() and [empowering uses they find morally repugnant for reasons far less esoteric than software freedom](https://github.com/lerna/lerna/pull/1616).  It's fairly easy to see in license terms, since they're well documented.  But the same plays out in myriad ways.  The artificer learns to subsist on half-measures: the right tool or decision, but optimized for a different purpose, and inevitably ill-suited in particular circumstances.

# Unsettled

There's no reason the artificer outlook ought to settle for scraps off other parties' tables.  The artificer view is consistent, and compelling, on its own.  In fact, it responds better and more clearly to many pressing issues in software.

For years, the popular press has gushed stories about surveillance, invasion of privacy, and the scurrilous practices of data- and ad-based software businesses.  Unlike Open Source, the artificer criticizes those companies from a position of principle.  Software can and should be built to afford control and protection of personal data.  Unlike Free Software, the artificer can criticize in the same terms that offended users employ.  Proprietary social networks are _broken_ insofar as they abuse users and squander what trust they're given, by poor design and insecure practice.  There's no call to drive the conversation away from privacy toward a jargon-leaden, highly abstract notion of software freedom, and then back into privacy by exhorting auntie to learn Unix and patch her social network.

For years, both Free Software and Open Source have extolled the power of programmers working on problems that call to them, rather than problems to which they're assigned.
