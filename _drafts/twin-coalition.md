title: Twin Coalitions

We are witnessing the rebirth of a forgotten coalition in open software, older than the term "open source" itself: activist hackers and upstart businesspeople.  Strange bedfellows.  But they share an interest in rattling the status quo of the software industry, instead of reinforcing it.  They unite around radical copyleft licensing as a defensive weapon to protect their insurgencies.  They need terms that make "free for open software" mean what it says, legally and practically.

We know well this coalition's twin, the union of BSD-school, anti-IP hackers and established software companies.  These equally strange bedfellows share an interest in eliminating transaction costs: legal review of terms, compatibility issues, and enforcement actions.  They unite around permissive licensing, an equally radical legal tool, as a means to [reverse their way out of the defaults of intellectual property law](https://oss.kemitchell.com/#operating-environment).  The permissive coalition needs license terms that make "free for whatever you want" mean what it says, legally and practically.

# Split

Recent history is not so balanced.  The permissive coalition has held the spotlight for the past decade.  That's testament to the success of the movement that coined "open source", and its goal of widespread enterprise adoption.

The open source movement jettisoned the radical rhetoric and lefty stylings of the copyleft coalition's activist arm, embodied by Richard Stallman and the Free Software Foundation.  It filled the resulting void with the loose economic rhetoric and libertarian stylings of Eric Raymond and the Open Source Initiative.  But the open source movement could not, and did not, jettison the copyleft coalition's business constituency.  Quite the opposite:  It had to court that constituency, split it away from radical hackerdom, if possible.  After all, the vast majority of businesses are small, and managers at smaller firms have more discretion to try radical departures from received business wisdom, as was open source at the time.  Open source could and did secure its foothold in smaller organizations.

As a consequence, the open source movement couldn't cast aside the licenses that served the business arm of the copyleft coalition, as producers of new software under competition or consumers of important activist projects, either.  Even though they were [decked out in the very activist trappings open source was trying to cast off](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.en.html#preamble).  Early in its life, the Open Source Initiative approved [functional copyleft alternatives without the rhetoric](https://opensource.org/licenses/Sleepycat).  But it went still further, approving stronger copyleft licenses than those drafted by the activist FSF, drafted purposefully as defensive tools for open leaning software companies.

Thus with [Plan 9](https://opensource.org/licenses/Plan9), the [Reciprocal Public License](https://opensource.org/licenses/RPL-1.5), and [Open Watcom](https://opensource.org/licenses/Watcom-1.0), all circa 2002, all of which the Free Software Foundation _rejected_ for reasons that resonated with some activist hackers, but not their upstart business bedfellows.  That rift was partially closed when both organizations approved the [GNU Affero GPL](https://opensource.org/licenses/Watcom-1.0), a license originally written for a business plan to get activist-type hackers paid, amidst incredible controversy.  The controversy quite despite OSI having previously approved [OSL](https://opensource.org/licenses/OSL-3.0), an even stronger network-copyleft license written by OSI's own legal counsel.  But by the time GNU AGPL came around, the political environment had begun to change.
