Many readers will have seen MongoDB's announcement of the [Server Side Public License, Version 1](https://www.mongodb.com/licensing/server-side-public-license), a new strong-copyleft license applied to the MongoDB database.  SSPLv1 is based on the AGPLv3, the Free Software Foundation's latest network-copyleft license.  MongoDB have submitted SSPLv1 to the Open Source Initiative for review.

Commentators have drawn comparisons to the License Zero Reciprocal Public License (L0-R), predecessor to the [Parity Public License](https://licensezero.com/licenses/parity), one of the two public licenses developers can use through License Zero.  I submitted L0-R to the OSI last year.

Parity and SSPLv1 both push the boundaries of strong copyleft in open source licensing.  Both require sharing back more code in more situations than AGPLv3, OSL 3.0, or even RPL 1.5.  Both were drafted with dual licensing, or selling exceptions, in mind, but in terms general enough for reuse by other developers, with or without any dual licensing.

Parity and SSPLv1 differ in a number of ways, but the most important is when their copyleft terms apply.  Parity always requires contributing code back.
