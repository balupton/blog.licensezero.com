Many readers will have seen MongoDB's announcement of the [Server Side Public License, Version 1](https://www.mongodb.com/licensing/server-side-public-license), a new copyleft license written for MongoDB.  SSPLv1 is based on the AGPLv3, the Free Software Foundation's network-copyleft license.  MongoDB Inc. has submitted SSPLv1 to the Open Source Initiative for review.

Commentators have drawn comparisons to the License Zero Reciprocal Public License (L0-R), predecessor to the [Parity Public License](https://licensezero.com/licenses/parity), one of the two public licenses developers can use through License Zero.  I submitted L0-R to the OSI last year.

Parity and SSPLv1 both push the boundaries of strong copyleft in open source licensing.  Both require sharing back more code in more situations than AGPLv3, OSL 3.0, or even RPL 1.5.  Both were drafted with business needs in mind.

Parity and SSPLv1 differ in a number of ways, but the most important is when their stronger copyleft terms apply.  Parity requires contributing code back in all cases that GPLv3 and AGPLv3 do, and then some.  SSPLv1 requires sharing code in many cases that AGPLv3 does not, but does _not_ require sharing code in many cases that AGPLv3 does.    For some use cases, SSPLv1 is designed to work like a permissive license.  Thus SSPLv1 is a strong copyleft license, but also a selective copyleft license, while Parity is a consistently strong copyleft license.

Those who favor Parity and those who favor SSPLv1 share an interest in common.  Both want open source copyleft to require sharing more code back, and in more situations.  In other words, both want to strengthen open source copyleft.  But SSPLv1 and Parity address fundamentally different use cases.
