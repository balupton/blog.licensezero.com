Correct: It's about a power relationship.

Wrong: The power relationship motivating the change is between developers and users.  It's between different developers, namely Redis Labs and cloud providers.

The community welcomes contributions from companies _that have already established themselves selling nonfree software and services_.  Redis Labs is opting back onto the very path you seem to be telling them they should walk.

The analogy to the environmental movement is inapt.

The bet on AGPL versus Commons Clause misses entirely the point that Redis Labs' modules _were_ AGPL, and they found themselves falling right through a loophole that license does not close.

"Opposition", but why wouldn't Redis Labs eventually move toward more permissive licensing, once established?
