A cliche keeps ringing in my ears:

> I feel taken for granted.

A lot of independent open source software maintainers feel taken for granted.  Of course they do.

In cold, pragmatic terms, giving code to public GitHub or npm says "take it".  Slapping MIT, BSD, or a similar permissive license on the code says "granted".  Maintainers feel taken for granted.  But they are giving their work away to be taken, and granting all the permission they can for it.

Not just maintainers.  The thing we call "open source" eats all kinds of contributions.  Documentation.  Submission guidelines.  Writing on public forums and bug trackers.  Mission statements.  Governance documents.  Hours and hours of real effort, distilled to prose, code, data, and institutions, then taken for granted by others.  Because it is.  Under `LICENSE` terms and terms of service.  Under laws that make permission irrelevant.

Once you've given work for granted, it's hard to go back and bargain for more of anything, especially money.  You find yourself asking something---cash, help, opportunity---for nothing, the cost of work you've given away.  When you ask, many around, even those who praised, recognized, and paid you before, aren't moved to action by your contributions.  Another cliche seems to ring in their ears:

> But what have you done for me lately?

I've met so many open source people facing this wall.  Maintainers looking back on years of useful, popular contributions, wondering how to catch up after investing so much on others' behalf.  Maintainers looking at what they've been able to do so far, knowing they could and should do so much more, but doing less, so ends continue to meet.  People finding that, per the popular wisdom, the answer to open source sustainability is writing proprietary software, or peddling secrets, or flexing political muscle, or going into marketing.  People finding that, per Economics 101, public goods like open source always come with free-rider problems, and winners take every ride they can get.

In these broad, simplistic strokes, the choice boils down to a stark one.  You can't make money on open source software you've already written.  That's given and taken for granted.  So run contractor gauntlet, perpetually selling what new open source you can make tomorrow, pointing back to past work to justify rates high enough to save your way to security.  Or contribute to proprietary software that will pay tomorrow even if all the work gets done today, through stock options or other ownership.
