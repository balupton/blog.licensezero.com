A cliche keeps ringing in my ears:

> I feel taken for granted.

A lot of independent open source software maintainers feel taken for granted.  Of course they do.

In cold, pragmatic terms, giving code to public GitHub or npm says "take it".  Slapping MIT, BSD, or a similar permissive license on the code says "granted".  Maintainers feel taken for granted.  But they are giving their work away to be taken, and granting all the permission they can for it.

Not just maintainers.  The thing we call "open source" eats all kinds of contributions.  Documentation.  Submission guidelines.  Writing on public mailing lists, chat channels, and bug trackers.  Mission statements.  Governance documents.  Hours and hours of real effort, distilled to prose, code, data, and institutions, then taken for granted by others.  Because it is.

Once you've given work for granted, it's hard to go back and bargain for more of anything, especially money.  You find yourself asking something---cash, help, opportunity---for nothing, the cost of work you've given away.  When you ask, even many of those who praised, recognized, and paid you before aren't moved to action by your contributions.  Their memories seem to cut short, and another cliche seems to ring in their ears:

> But what have you done for me lately?

I've met so many open source people facing this wall.  Maintainers looking back on years of useful, popular contributions, wondering how to catch up after investing so much on others' behalf.  Maintainers looking at what they've been able to do so far, knowing they could and should do so much more, but doing less, so ends continue to meet.  People finding that, per the popular wisdom, the answer to open source sustainability is writing proprietary software, or peddling secrets, or flexing political muscle, or going into marketing.  People finding that, per Economics 101, public goods like open source always come with free-rider problems, and winners don't give free rides, but take them.

In these broad, simplistic strokes, the choices appears stark.  You can't look back to open source software you've already released for support.  That's given, and taken, for granted.  So accept that your path to a reasonable income will be almost entirely forward-looking.  Run the contractor gauntlet, perpetually selling what new open source you can make tomorrow, pointing back to past work only when helpful to justify rates high enough to save your way to security.  Or compensate for open source's limitation by adopting a model that fills the gap.  Contribute to proprietary software that pay tomorrow even if all the work gets done today.  Or do both.  But accept that while open source may be technically better, it's financially broken on its own.
