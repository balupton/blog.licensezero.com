We use different, parallel vocabulary to talk about success in software.  In the business frame, we speak of profit, payment, customers, finance, companies, services, and management.  In the other frame, which I'll dub "community", with big scare quotes, we speak of sustainability, donations, adopters, support, foundations, infrastructure, and governance.  Corresponding terms convey the same fundamental ideas.  But there is also a fundamental, implicit difference.

When we frame developers' needs in "community" terms, we impose an implicit limit on reasonable worldly expectations.  We expect "community" developers, even well known ones, to scrounge a bit, even to suffer, just as we expect artists, even famous ones, to struggle, even to starve.  Conversely, when we frame developers' needs in business terms, we put a cap on cool factor.  We expect business programmers, even accomplished ones, to spend a lot of time writing mundane software for mundane business needs, just as we expect commercial illustrators, even established ones, to draw lots of fast food, soda pop bottles, and svelte smiling people.

The usual troubles with either-or distinctions, explicit or implicit, come down to misclassification and oversimplification.  Open developers trying to make ends meet bristle when others "community" them.  They learn that those terms severely complicate, and limit, achievement of their goals.  Entrepreneurial software types, for their part, bristle at heavy handed business speak.  They learn that those terms endlessly frustrate, and hobble, their ability to express and achieve greater purpose through their ventures.

As far as I'm aware, there is no available vocabulary for developers who mix or balance devotion to craft and worldly success.  Attempts to construct one reek of marketing bullshit or try-hard gunner-ism.  Instinctively, we presume those mixing terms, or inventing middle ones, try to seem what they're not.

If you find yourself consistently occupying one archetype or the other, or balancing both with clear separation, two distinct categories can reinforce a pleasant feeling of separate worlds, grass-is-greener, yin and yang.  Some programmers rush home from work to pound TV meals and churn out open source, where none of the boss's rules apply.  Many freelancers take comfort in offices that look and feel very different from home life, even if the office is actually just a separate room in the home.

We can take similar comfort in a change of linguistic scenery.  Work looks like work, sounds like work, and feels like work.  Home looks like home, sounds like home, and feels like home.  Thanks in part to their parallel vocabularies, open and closed look, sound, and feel distinct, and for some, that's a feeling of comfort, that all is right in the software world.
