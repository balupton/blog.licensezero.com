For a good long time, industry as a whole refused to use open source software, even open source software under permissive licenses.

We still see contract terms prohibiting or tightly controlling open source use in enterprise forms today.

Now acceptance of permissively licensed open source is popular.  But we continue to see bans on copyleft software.

When _all_ open source was banned, enterprises treated all open source as they treat copyleft software today.

Since enterprises refused to use even permissively licensed open source software, releasing even permissively licensed open source software created competitive advantage for allies of open source.
