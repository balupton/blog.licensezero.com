For a good long time, industry spurned open source software, even under permissive licenses.  We still see contract terms prohibiting open source use in legal forms today, as industry increasingly adopts open source for internal software projects, especially open source under permissive licenses like MIT, BSD, and Apache.

When open source was banned entirely, industry treated all open source, permissive and copyleft, as they treat copyleft software today.

Since the industry mainstream refused to use even permissively licensed open source software, releasing open source software under nearly any kind of license created a competitive advantage for open-counterculture allies.  Releasing code under a BSD license made it available to fellow open source developers, working independent or starting companies.
