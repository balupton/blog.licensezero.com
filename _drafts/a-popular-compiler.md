GCC was the killer app of free software.  It demonstrated the collaborative model, proved the license, and spread free software ideology.  But GCC, for all that it's special, for all the definitions of success that it achieves, also demonstrates the cost of free software's compromises.  It demonstrates the long-term cost of short-term decision.

The trouble with GCC is that it's a compiler.  A compiler is first and foremost used to compile computer programs.  It is only secondarily, by a distant margin, used to build additional compilers.
