If you're a developer unhappy with the open source status quo, you need leverage to improve it.  You need leverage just to start the conversation about improving it.

Right now, open source consumers have it good.  It's not in their immediately apparent, short-term interest to entertain change, other than change that asks more of open source producers.  Without leverage, or willingness to use it, conversations about "sustainability" start out acknowledging that independent open source developers can't sustain what they already do with so little, but end with [lists of more things independent open source developers ought to do](https://medium.com/libraries-io/what-does-a-sustainable-open-source-project-look-like-bf9b8cf824f8).  Security.  Documentation.  Release notes.  Making yourself replaceable.

Open source consumers have headcount, well-understood organizational structures, money, and clout.  What do open source developers have that they can sell or wield, to escape the downward spiral toward burnout and replacement?

# Convenience

Platforms used to make and distribute open source software give developers power to take action online in centralized, discoverable places that are easiest for consumers to find and use.  By taking on those burdens, and leveraging the network effects around names, open source developers make a lot of convenience for consumers.

## Collaboration Platform Permissions

As an open source developer, Open source developers have accounts on revision control, bug tracking, and patch submission systems.  Their accounts have permissions that allow them to do what consumers of their software cannot, and to decide what consumers can do in the relevant parts of those platforms.

Consumers have the power to fork projects.  But there are significant network-effect detriments to any fork, even a fork whose sole purpose is floating a patch.  It's just more convenient to go to one place for code, questions, development, history, builds, and so on.

Developers can leverage this potential for convenience into support by prioritizing support requests and patches from those who support them, or replacing open channels for support with paid, private channels.

## Distribution System Permissions

Open source developers have powerful accounts on artifact distribution systems like [npm](https://www.npmjs.com).  Those accounts have permissions to publish new versions under well known names that are easy to consumer with package managers.

Consumers can also sign up for accounts, and publish forks or even copies of open source work.  But for discoverability and search purposes, it's far more convenient to have a single name that always points to the latest work.

Developers can leverage this potential for convenience into support by selling binaries and other build products.  The work they publish as open source may even include all configuration necessary to make those builds.  But many consumers will find it more convenient to pay a price than invoke a build chain.

# Power

Community rules and dynamics afford open source maintainers will significant power, which they can use to compel support.

## Intellectual Property Law

Intellectual property laws give independent developers enforceable rights over the use of their code and distinctive names they give their code, like project names.  When others use that code, or those names, without permission, the developer can potentially sue.  The ability to sue for money gives the rights holder leverage to get paid up front, for licenses, rather than after the fact, for infringement.

License Zero leverages this power with licenses that give many users permission to use for free, but require users [for commercial purposes](https://licensezero.com/licenses/noncommercial) or [in proprietary, closed software](https://licensezero.com/licenses/reciprocal) to buy permission.

In some aspects, as with copyright in source code, open source consumers may have alternatives.  They might clean room reimplement an open source library, for example.  In other aspects, as with marketing use of a trademarked name, or use of a patented algorithm, there's no such workaround.  If the open source maintainer has the rights and an open source consumer needs the rights, the consumer needs the maintainer's permission, which may come at the price of support.

## Influence

The social side of writing software can vest open source developers with peculiar notoriety and influence on the attention and preferences of other developers.  That attention can translate into more open source contribution along particular lines of development, increased use of tools, libraries, and other projects, and signals to those producing educational, reference, and other resources.  In a word: fashion.

Open source notoriety competes with other interests and resources in setting current fashion.  Company hiring policies.  Outreach programs.  But open source maintainer influence is also a factor.

Open source developers can leverage their influence into support by accepting donations to use particular development tools and services, even paid tools and services, in visible ways.

# Freedom

The fact that a developer made a particular piece of useful open source yesterday does not mean that they have to make improvements to it today, or other open source software consumers would like tomorrow.  Independent open source developer control their time, and their contributions.

## What to Do Next

The freedom to decide what work to do next gives independent open source developers the ability to sell that freedom to companies, in the form of service contracts.  Those service contracts may produce more open source software, they may produce proprietary software, or they may produce no software at all, but only advice or consulting.

Companies can always hire other developers to do these things, as well.  But an open source developer can often get them done more efficiently, especially if they relate to their prior open source work.

[Switchmode](https://github.com/switchmode/switchmode) is a free, open form contract for developers doing a mix of open and closed work.  Its terms are compatible with open source work, in both the proprietary and paid-open-source contexts, unlike any standard consulting contracts.  It's designed to take away the legal friction of doing deals between companies and open source leaning developers.

## Private Knowledge

The ideal open source project is entirely open and transparent.  Some may know it better than others, but everything necessary to read up---user documentation, developer documentation, overviews of key implementation decisions, hosting guides, deployment configurations---comes with the project.  It is up to the developer of the open source project how much of this knowledge actually gets written out in the open, and how much of it they retain privately.  For parts of this knowledge that are hard to relate to others in writing---tacit knowledge, like the philosophy behind a project or tool set---it's up to the developer how much time they spend developing ways to make that knowledge explicit, instead.

Open source developers can leverage private knowledge into support by selling training, consulting, and other services, or by selling copies of, or access to, proprietary materials like books, documentation, and training guides.
