If you're a developer unhappy with the open source status quo, you need leverage to improve it.  You need leverage just to start the conversation about improving it.

Right now, open source consumers have it good.  It's not in their immediately apparent, short-term interest to entertain change, other than refining and expanding expectations for open source developers.  Without leverage, or willingness to use it, conversations about "sustainability" start out acknowledging that independent open source developers can't sustain what they already do with so little, but end with [lists of more things independent open source developers should do](https://medium.com/libraries-io/what-does-a-sustainable-open-source-project-look-like-bf9b8cf824f8).

Open source consumers have headcount, well-understood organizational structures, money, and clout.  What do open source developers have that they can sell or wield, to escape the downward spiral toward burnout and replacement?

# Convenience

Various platforms that we use to make and distribute open source software give developers power to take action online in centralized, discoverable places that are easiest for consumers to find and use.  Open source developers make a lot of convenience for consumers by using their accounts in these ways.

## Collaboration Platform Permissions

As an open source developer, Open source developers have accounts on revision control, bug tracking, and patch submission systems.  Their accounts have permissions that allow them to do what consumers of their software cannot, and to decide what consumers can do in the relevant parts of those platforms.

Consumers have the power to fork projects.  But there are significant network-effect detriments to any fork, even a fork whose sole purpose is floating a particular patch.

## Distribution System Permissions

Open source developers have powerful accounts on artifact distribution systems, like [npm](https://www.npmjs.com).  Those accounts have permissions to publish new versions under well known names.
