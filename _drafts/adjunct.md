Trapped in social networks that manipulate and abuse us.
Trapped on marketplaces that sell (and leak) info about us.
Trapped in closed, proprietary software we can't opt out of.
Trapped making closed, proprietary software for others.
Making closed, proprietary software out of open source.

Open source software is winning. Software freedom is not. If
there were ever a case for a difference, there it is.

A reverse correlation: open source up, software freedom
down. But not a coincidence. Open source "wins" in large
part by shedding software freedom and accepting a role as
adjunct to to proprietary software. It's more efficient to
build proprietary networks---social, commercial, and
otherwise---using open source. But it's more profitable,
prevailing practice suggests, to offer users of those
systems no meaningful right to patch, fork, or even set
user-facing policy.

I can improve Facebook's front-end framework, improving
Facebook's ability to make front-end changes. I can fork
Twitter's databases, making twitter.com cheaper for Twitter,
Inc. to run. But Facebook isn't a front-end framework, and
Twitter isn't a database. I can't improve the network parts
of those networks for myself. Even if sloughing away all the
open source reveals but a relatively thin layer of
proprietary integration code, that layer makes the decisions
that affect the user, that set rules and incentives
throughout the network. Patches to that layer aren't
welcome. That power belongs to the host.

Network power is pervasive power. Networks represent
standing value propositions. Those propositions compel, less
by what the network hosts offer, and more by what other
users offer. We'll abide a creepy social network to be
social with the right people. We'll abide a jostling market
maker to find the products and prices we need.

Software freedom laid our collective foundation. And
software freedom advocates aspired, consciously, to network
power. In specific domains, the GPL still wields. It's so
much easier to port GCC to your new architecture than to
write a brand new compiler. It's so much easier to tweak
WordPress than to seed your own blog-platform community.
Software freedom isn't _enforced_, emphasis _force_. Life is
simply better with free run of GPL software than without it.

That network power affects not just software that software
freedom loving hackers write. It affects trade-offs for all
software writers.  Including freedom loving hackers at work
at companies utterly indifferent about, or hostile to,
software freedom.

In the end, only pervasive network power can exert
meaningful, user-centric power across the board.
