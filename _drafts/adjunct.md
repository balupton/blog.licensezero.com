description: open source as adjunct to proprietary software

Trapped in social networks that manipulate and abuse us.
Trapped on marketplaces that sell (and leak) info about us.
Trapped with closed, proprietary programs we can't opt out of.
Trapped making closed, proprietary networks and programs for others.

Making closed, proprietary software out of open source.

As software developers, today's hand-wringing about privacy
and manipulation seems laughably overdue. Software people,
knowing how software gets made, often choose to use very
differently from mom, pop, and the kids.
When we do join into mainstream networks and services,
we deploy technical measures, from privacy settings to
browser extensions and anonymization tools, that come
easily just to nerds like us.

Open source software is winning. Software freedom is not. If
there were ever a short case for a difference, there it is.

Perhaps open source doesn't belong in conversations about
user rights, privacy protections, transparency, choice.
But it doesn't belong because it chooses not to belong.
Open source is free software minus software freedom.
Free software took a policy position on user-facing issues.
Open source takes a position on user-facing issues only
when the users facing issues happen to be programmers.

Open source "wins" in large part by accepting a role as
adjunct to to proprietary software. It's more efficient to
build proprietary networks---social, commercial, and
otherwise---using open source. But it's more profitable,
prevailing practice suggests, to offer users of those
systems no meaningful right to patch, fork, or set policy.

It's tempting to reassure ourselves that all software
is open source these days, because it's increasingly
made of open source.
And it's often true that, compared to the hard programming problems
solved in the database or the programming language or the
parser or the wire protocol---often open source---the
relatively thin layer of proprietary implementation, application
code, and design on top is merely [application-specific, brackish
residue that can't be so easily abstracted away][residue].

I can improve Facebook's front-end framework, improving
Facebook's ability to make front-end changes. I can fork
Twitter's databases, making twitter.com cheaper for Twitter,
Inc. to run. But Facebook isn't a front-end framework, and
Twitter isn't a database. I can't improve the network parts
of those networks for myself. Even if sloughing away all the
open source reveals but a relatively thin layer of
proprietary integration code, that layer makes the decisions
that affect the user, that set rules and incentives
throughout the network. Patches to that layer aren't
welcome. That power belongs to the host.

Network power is pervasive power. Networks represent
standing value propositions. Those propositions compel, less
by what the network hosts offer, and more by what other
users offer. We'll abide a creepy social network to be
social with the right people. We'll abide a jostling market
maker to find the products and prices we need.

Software freedom laid our collective foundation. And
software freedom advocates aspired, consciously, to network
power. In specific domains, the GPL still wields. It's so
much easier to port GCC to your new architecture than to
write a brand new compiler. It's so much easier to tweak
WordPress than to seed your own blog-platform community.
Software freedom isn't _enforced_, emphasis _force_. Life is
simply better with free run of GPL software than without it.

That network power affects not just software that software
freedom loving hackers write. It affects trade-offs for all
software writers.  Including freedom loving hackers at work
at companies utterly indifferent about, or hostile to,
software freedom.

In the end, only pervasive network power can exert
meaningful, user-centric power across the board.
