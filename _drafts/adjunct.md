description: open source as adjunct to proprietary software

Sucked into social networks that manipulate and abuse us.
Drawn into marketplaces that sell  data about us. Stuck with
closed, proprietary programs we can't opt out of. Trapped
making closed, proprietary programs to trap others.

Making closed, proprietary software out of open source.

As software developers, today's hand-wringing about privacy
and manipulation seems comically, pitiably late. Software
people know how software business gets done, and partake
more judiciously. When we join into mainstream networks and
services, we take steps, from privacy settings to browser
extensions and anonymization tools, that come easily only to
our kind. But we know they're just half-measures. We're tech
people, but we might as well be plumbers, as far as other
devs' apps are concerned.

Open source software is winning. Software freedom is not. If
there were ever a short case for a difference, there it is.

Perhaps open source doesn't belong in conversations about
user rights, privacy protections, transparency, choice. But
it chooses not to belong. Free software takes a position on
user-facing issues. Open source takes a position on
user-facing issues only when the users happen to be
programmers.

That's why open source "wins". It wins, dilutely, because
proprietary software wins, and open source accepts a role as
adjunct to proprietary software. It's more efficient to
build proprietary code---social networks, commercial
networks, locked-in user communities---using open source
code. But it's more profitable to offer users of those
systems no meaningful right to patch, fork, or set policy.
So the business plan goes.

It's tempting to reassure ourselves that all software
is open source these days, because it's increasingly made of
open source and [made like open source][innersource]. And
it's often true that, compared to the hard programming
problems solved in the database or the programming language
or the parser or the wire protocol---often open---the layer
of closed implementation, application code, and design on
top looks relatively thin.

I can improve Facebook's front-end framework, increasing
Facebook's ability to make cost-efficient front-end changes.
I can optimize Twitter's databases, making twitter.com
cheaper for Twitter, Inc. to run. But Facebook isn't a
front-end framework, and Twitter isn't a database. I can't
improve the network parts of those networks for myself. Even
if sloughing away all the open source reveals but a
relatively thin film of proprietary integration, that layer
makes the decisions that affect user-users, that set rules,
capabilities, and incentives. Patches to that layer aren't
welcome. That's a network-owner prerogative.

Network power is pervasive power. Networks represent
standing value propositions. Those propositions compel, less
by what the network owners offer, and more by what the users
they attract offer. We'll abide a creepy social network to
be social with the right people. We'll abide a jostling
market maker to find the products and prices we need.

Software freedom laid our collective foundation. And
software freedom advocates aspired, consciously, to network
power. In specific domains, the GPL still wields. It's so
much easier to port GCC to your new architecture than to
write a brand new compiler. It's so much easier to tweak
WordPress than to seed your own blog-platform community.
Software freedom isn't _enforced_, emphasis _force_. Life is
simply better with free run of GPL software than without it.

That network power affects not just software that software
freedom loving hackers write. It affects trade-offs for all
software writers.  Including freedom loving hackers at work
at companies utterly indifferent about, or hostile to,
software freedom.

In the end, only pervasive network power can exert
meaningful, user-centric power across the board.
