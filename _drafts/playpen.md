Abstract away the implementation details, there's really just one open source business model.  Give enough away to please the hobby hackers, hackathon heroes, and MVP mavens.  Pick a target market, find out what on top of that they want, and charge for it.  Collect your applause and attention from social media, meetups, and the conference circuit, and leverage it to .

From there, it's just a tuning problems.  Want to sell large corporations, one at a time, with big, setpiece, recurring-revenue deals?  Find out what they want, don't give it away, and make sure you don't make it easy for others to do so, either.
