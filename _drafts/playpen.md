Look past the implementation details, there's really just one open source business model.  Give enough away to please the hobby hackers, hackathon heroes, and MVP cowboys.  Pick a target market that isn't those people, find out what else they'll want, and charge for it.  Collect your applause and attention from social media, meetups, and the conference circuit, and leverage it to sneak saunter your way under customers' attention and hawk your wares.

From there, implementation's just a tuning problem.  The better you know what your market wants, and how they want to buy it, the better you can shape yourself to fit the hole.  In time, with money, you can begin to shape the hole to fit you, instead.

Want to sell large corporations, enterprise deal by enterprise deal, with big, setpiece, recurring-revenue contracts?  Find out what big companies want, make it (or promise to make it), make sure you don't accidentally give it away, and make sure you don't invite others to do so, either.

If your leads want to license your software to install and run themselves, congratulations, you are now "open core".  Your challenge is deciding and explaining what features go on which side of the open-closed line.  Also preventing freeloaders from competing with you on the close side without paying the same open cost of entry that you did.

If your leads want you to run run your software for them, congratulations, you are now a "cloud" company.  Your challenge is deciding and explaining what features will only be available from you, or in your hosted version.  Also preventing others from making your own project too easy to self-host, or the scale-mindshare advantages of incumbent, general-purpose cloud providers from capping your upside.

As a general rule, the bigger the customers you want to sell, the bigger you will have to become, and the bigger you will have to act, before you actually grow to that scale.
