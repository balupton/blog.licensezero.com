before github
before open source
before free software
before hacks or hackers or hacking
  by those or other names
people who saw beauty in the machines
people who saw magic in the machines
wanted something back
  from the industry
  they created
  and that created them

some wanted community
  of friends to work
  and to play with

some wanted purpose
  as freedoms to fight for
  and causes to serve

some wanted identity
  as credit, esteem, even fame
  beyond the corporate environment

some wanted still other things
  but their stories
  we never learned to tell

everyone
  who's called to work with these machines
  inherits an industry
  and inherits a movement

the industry
  has always wanted
  money
  and time
  and talent
  and thought

the movement has always wanted something back

industry takes
  that is what industry is

there is no shame
there is a duty
to want something back

1

our most important stories
  tell of a time
  when much was taken back

trains
and mainframes
and unices
and licenses
and freedoms
and a culture

but the experience
  of our lives
