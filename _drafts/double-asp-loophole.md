> In regard to modified versions, the HESSLA's restrictions are unnecessary. The GNU GPL is, in general, sufficient protection against privacy-violating features, because it ensures that someone can get the source code, find the spyware feature, and publish an improved version of the software which does not have the feature. Users can then switch to that version if they don't want their personal information to be reported.

The GNU GPL is not and has not been sufficient protection against privacy-violating features, especially when use of a particular program, such as a web app that a company is running for you, enjoys the benefit of network effects.  Even when such apps are subject to _Affero_-GPL-like conditions, the ability to switch to a privacy-respecting alternative does nothing to guarantee that the value of that alternative will match that of the privacy-violating incumbent.
