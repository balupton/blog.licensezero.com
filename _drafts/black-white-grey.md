title: Black or White in a Messy Grey World
---

Early open-source software stalwarts made the big stage by hammering hard on a single human value: freedom.  We're all born free to compute as we please, and computer programmers shouldn't stop us with "intellectual property".  But apart from a few cerebral zealots, almost nobody's real-world morality boils down to just "Can folks do what they wanna?"  Doing what's right just isn't so black-and-white.

We care about those near to us.  We care about personal relationships, respect, and fairness.  We care about connections to higher things and purposes.  We seek a balance of those concerns when they conflict, as we learn they often do.

Values conflicts are gushing out of one-dimensional open source absolutism as more people get involved and connect socially, not just collaboratively, online.

Black-and-white software freedom enables users, even encourages them, to disregard or abuse the people behind the software they use.  We have seen developers chided into slapping an MIT license on their work for the benefit of those asking, not the one developing.  We have seen bug reports demanding small features and fixes with fetid entitlement and nary a whiff of thanks.

Black-and-white software freedom enables competitors to snatch the moneymaking potential of other developers' work right out of their hands.  We have seen developers sacrifice to keep pace with a growing, popular creation, only to find they're outcompeted by runaway incumbents every which way they turn for an honest buck: by selling swag, documentation, support, training, consulting, or hosting.  We have seen those incumbents work, consciously and by natural selection of prevailing opinion, to hammer on the freedoms that play into the traps of their advantages, or expand the meaning of "open" or "truly open" to like effect.

Black-and-white software freedom enables powerful newcomers to undermine the leadership of long-serving creators and maintainers. We have seen developers booted from leadership positions by new-user people, marginalized and threatened by hostile forks from consortia of powerful household names, and cloned by their pricey staff and consultant engineers.  We have seen the notion of practical credit for one's work fall from respected license condition to broadly ignored administrative chore to license-terms mortal sin.

Black-and-white software freedom enables takers to turn makers' work against the very things they hold sacred.  We've seen web tech turned into ad tech, computer vision into surveillance, and cryptographic systems into boiler-room playbooks.  We've seen it all compiled, debugged, and deployed using "share like" tools, with nary a line of shared code in sight.

When software-freedom absolutism manages to do some good in any of these moral dimensions, the true believer happily takes credit.  But when software-freedom takes a toll in these other dimensions, the faithful blame the victim---You shouldn't have made it open source, like we told you to!---or simply write the damage off as the collateral of freedom.

Black-and-white software freedom, like any black-and-white ethics, trades completeness and dirty realism for expedience and clean clarity.  It's a bad moral deal.  Just as computer programming often boils down to reducing a complex problem to a computable approximation, ethical conversations trapped within software, which only step outside the programming context to grab vague positives like "freedom" and "community", derive a neatly computable ethics for a bad approximation of life.

The result in application is disastrous.  Just as software reductionism so often looses evil systems on the world that looked good in theory, moral reductionism makes wanton moral automata of otherwise capable people, blind or indifferent to meaningful consequences.  The comfort of sound theory, of easy certainty, must be preserved.  Morality _must_ be reduced to Turing-esque deductive terms, because the goal is to make those doing the computing feel good about it, not to do right by those being computed.

In American politics, we see a similarly reactive interplay of values systems.  Those shocked or directly oppressed by abusive structures of authority, influence, and religion work out their frustrations by hammering hard on justice and compassion, denying, more or less, that authority, influence, or religion has anything to offer anyone but the elect.  Some of those same activists, and a great many others, come to focus on a single, identifiable symbol of their oppression: the government.  All of those formative experiences are real, and all the lessons taken from them very genuine.  But the result is an unworkable politics of shouting extremes, at the expense of more holistic, the-world-is-grey-soup approaches that don't fit anyone's black-and-white narrative.

Early programmers felt oppressed and abused by companies' use of nondisclosure agreements and copyright licenses, and learned a knee-jerk liberty-liberalism by quasi-Skinnerian experience.  They vilified, and made common cause with those who vilified, the single culprit of intellectual property law, symbolic source of all evil they abhorred.  RMS made a noble deal with that devil, but it worked out like that usually does.

Now a new generation of programmers feels oppressed and abused _by companies' use of open source_.  They are learning a knee-jerk reflex against it, despite aspects they value very highly, aspects that often brought them into software in the first place.  They are learning that doing as open source orthodoxy prescribes, in the best case, can mean getting drawn between a runaway project they just can't put down and an industry primed to scout, seize, and strip-mine all life-sustaining moneymaking value from up-and-coming projects with teams, talent, brand recognition, and network effects wee Shire folk can never match.  When they protest, they learn that the "ethical" option is to join that system as a W-2 employee, or else face down bully brigades of moral condemnation for having objected to the obvious wrongness of the outcome.  O'Reilly.  Red Hat.  Now Amazon.  Next some other new billion-dollar company.  Not you.  You can at best form an also-ran, rounding-error competitor that the runaway winners will cite against monopoly charges in their antitrust proceedings.
