If you're a developer unhappy with the open source status quo, you need leverage to improve it.  You need leverage just to start the conversation about improving it.

Right now, open source consumers have it pretty good.  It's not in their immediately apparent, short-term interest to entertain ideas about changes, other than changes which require more from open source producers.  Conversations about "sustainability" start by acknowledging that open source producers can't do so much with so little, and end with [lists of more things open source producers should do](https://medium.com/libraries-io/what-does-a-sustainable-open-source-project-look-like-bf9b8cf824f8).

Open source consumers have headcount, well-understood organizational structures, money, and clout.  What do open source producers have?

# Collaboration Platform Permissions

Open source developers have powerful accounts on revision control, bug tracking, and patch submission systems.  Their accounts have permissions that allow them to do what consumers of their software cannot.

# Package Distribution Permissions

Open source developers have powerful accounts on artifact distribution systems, like [npm](https://www.npmjs.com).  Those accounts have permissions to publish new versions under well known names.

# Intellectual Property Law

# Tacit Knowledge

# The Ability to Shirk
