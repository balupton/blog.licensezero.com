title: Profit for Us, Sustainability for You

We used to talk of open source as a commons enriching all comers.  Now we talk of open source as infrastructure to sustain.  That shift acknowledges how much of open source is inputs and tooling for proprietary software development.  But when the free work stops coming, sustainability asks what projects need to keep pace, not what people deserve as reward for value delivered.  Open source feels unfair because reward received falls shockingly short of value delivered.  Sustainability thinking sidesteps value, asking only how consumers can keep it flowing cheap.

Company-consumers of open source don't settle for sustenance at cost.  They work for profit, and charge what the market will bear.  Outside the corporate fold, today's initiatives tell open source developers to court patrons closer to the money, that dependence on enlightened self-interest is better living than dependence on charity.  Utterly disparate expectations.

Sustainability framing masks, and ingrains, that disparity.  Profit for us, sustainability for you.  What can you do to sustain this on less?  Train up unburned replacements?  Move to Thailand?  Rent forever?  Put off kids?

The sustainability conversation won't solve open source inequity for independent developers and small producer firms.  It doesn't try.  The conversation that can solve open source inequity is open source profitability.  What business models work, how do we improve them, and how can more people run them?

# Steps

Sustainability was a necessary, intermediate evolutionary step toward the conversation open source needs.

Open source developers hacking libraries and tools work as _specialists_.  They spend their time creating and refining precursors to larger projects.  Over time, specialized work becomes a full-time job.  The best specialists don't have time to reap rewards from the commons the old-fashioned way, by integrating others' work into profitable, proprietary, user-facing products and services.  They spend more time than they have on their specialties.

The commons isn't equally exploitable by all.  The expectation that individuals will be both full-time specialized producers and full-time generalist consumers falls down.

What companies can't do for a profit, we don't expect them to do very long.  But the archetypical open source specialist always comes batteries-included.  Incentive is never in question, or it's payable in currency that doesn't convert to cash.  For learning or for fame.  For beauty or correctness.  Simple addiction, even obsession.  All a kind of natural resource---like oil wells, gold seams, and timberland---exploitable to a profit by the willing and able.  But these motives exhaust.  Employees earning good bread in staid corporate environments relish outside open source opportunity, to spice up life.  But experienced, talented independents can't skip to love, esteem, and self-actualization on empty stomachs.

Compensation matters to open source producers, too.  Sustenance without reward won't sustain very long.

# Blocks

The sustainability evolution of the open source conversation required setting stereotypes of developers aside.  The profitability evolution of the open source conversation will require setting stereotypes of business aside.

Having a business model doesn't mean throwing ethics or good taste into a fire.  "Business" has a bad rep among idealists, earned primarily by large and unethical corporations.  It's perfectly possible to start a business, keep it relatively small, and consider goals above or in addition to profit.  "Profit" also has a bad rep, because we don't call wages and fees, brought in by individuals for honest work, but above what they require for basic needs, by the same name.  It's possible to profit without exploiting anyone.  In fact, profit can be a good sign you yourself aren't being exploited.  That your abilities, not your patron, is deciding what kind and quality of life you deserve.

License Zero aims to prove these in practice, by a specific method.  License Zero makes an old, established business model, dual-licensing, accessible to individual coder-maintainers and small firms.  It facilitates markets for license fees that reflect work value, not sustenance payments or charity.  It's non-exclusive, and not the only method that small players could adopt.  But it's evolved in the best way I could see.
