The mainstream open source funding conversation has shifted from mutual-benefit terms to sustainability terms.  That shift marks overdue acknowledgment that much open source helps create other software.  Its developers work as _specialists_.  All their time makes inputs of standalone products and services.  We can't tell them to reap their reward integrating others' open source into user-facing products, for which they could charge without anyone batting an eye, as consumers do.

From the point of view of a company selling standalone products and services, specialist open-source inputs save a lot of time and money.  Ideally, hackers would keep churning out free, high-quality inputs at pace, forever.  That is the meaning of open-source sustainability that resonates with consumers:  "Keep it coming!"

When open source developers can't keep it coming, the next question is "What does the project need?"  That enlightened self-interest is far better than ignorance.  But there is a very dark, hypocritical side to the frame of those conversations.  Companies want open source to be sustainable.  But many companies hungrily consuming open source would never settle for sustainability, themselves.  Companies fight to be _profitable_, and what they can't do for profit, we don't expect them to do very long.  It's not about the "project" of what the company offers.  It's about the company and what it makes from the project.
