Part of a series, _Unsustainability at Scale_

![Mr. Stay Puft](/images/staypuft.jpg)

GitHub has awesome cash and network advantages.  Through [Sponsors](https://github.blog/2019-05-23-announcing-github-sponsors-a-new-way-to-contribute-to-open-source/), announced today, they've applied them to a choice on "sustainability", and their choice will define "sustainability" within their network for the foreseeable future.  The blessed model is Patreon-style, voluntary payments for tiers of more or less meaningful perks.

Folks are busy wondering if this means doom or glory for this-or-that smaller-scale sustainability-as-a-service offering.  I suppose I might be wondering about License Zero, if I were the type.  But my mind keeps honing in on the real upshot.

We know the Patreon model.  We know its problems.

# Rockstars

A couple months ago, I compiled a table of top-earning open source software developers on Patreon:

| Developer       | As Of      | Amount  | Donors | Mean     | Platform                                                     | Perks                                                     |
| --------------- | ---------- | ------- | ------ | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Evan You        | 2019-03-24 | $17,621 | 236    | $74.6652 | [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/evanyou)                   | `backers.md`, vuejs.org, `README`                         |
| Eran Hammer     | 2019-03-24 | $3,179  | 39     | $81.5128 | [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/eranhammer)                | `SPONSORS.md`, Security Alerts Mailing List               |
| Sindre Sorhus   | 2019-03-24 | $1,904  | 207    | $9.198   | [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/sindresorhus)              | sindresorhus.com/thanks, `README`                         |
| Kent Overstreet | 2019-03-24 | $1,798  | 267    | $6.734…  | [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/bcachefs)                  | loose bug prioritization                                  |
| Henry Zhu       | 2019-03-24 | $1,593  | 167    | $9.5389  | [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/henryzhu)                  | henryzoo.com/thanks, ping-pong, BBQ, `README`, babeljs.io |
| Øyvind Kolås    | 2019-03-24 | $1,020  | 242    | $4.2148  | [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/pippin)                    | rendering demo text file, private previews                |
| Drew DeVault    | 2019-03-25 | $1,004  | 188    | $5.3404  | [PayPal](https://drewdevault.com/donate/), [Patreon](https://patreon.com/SirCmpwn), [Liberapay](https://liberapay.com/SirCmpwn) | chat channel, website, stickers, backer page, blog posts  |

The danger in this table is giving the false impression that open source software developers tend to receive meaningful amounts from patronage and donation platforms.  As a general rule, they don't.

These are the developers I could find earning more than $1,000 US per month, across platforms.  There are many, many, many more who ask to, and do not.

# Words

I salute GitHub's care in choice of words.

"Sponsors" is fairly neutral.  `FUNDING.yml` even more so.  Neither the blog post nor the FAQ announcing Sponsors says "donation".  Donations are not excluded, but the Sponsors program doesn't commit entirely to [the limiting vocabulary of "community"](https://blog.licensezero.com/2019/04/18/diglossia.html).
