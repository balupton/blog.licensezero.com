There's a take on copyleft that says:

> Copyleft doesn't achieve anything unless it applies to everyone, including the original developer.  If just one company can build proprietary add-ons, or sells exceptions, that's abusing copyleft as a business ploy.

We see the same view reflected in terms, like section 7 of [copyleft-next](https://github.com/copyleft-next/copyleft-next) 0.3.1, a kind of research license looking forward to the next GPL:

> ## Nullification of Copyleft/Proprietary Dual Licensing
>
> If I offer to license, for a fee, a Covered Work under terms other than a license that is OSI-Approved or FSF-Free as of the release date of this License or a numbered version of copyleft-next released by the Copyleft-Next Project, then the license I grant You under section 1 is no longer subject to the [copyleft] conditions in sections 3 through 5.

Much the same in the Free Software Foundation's [policy against making exceptions to the GPL](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/selling-exceptions.en.html) for its own projects.

But not so fast.  Dig around FSF.org long enough, and you'll find that RMS doesn't condemn selling exceptions to copyleft.  He accepts and encourages it.  [Quoting](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/selling-exceptions.en.html):

> I've considered selling exceptions acceptable since the 1990s, and on occasion I've suggested it to companies.  Sometimes this approach has made it possible for important programs to become free software.

RMS goes on to give the example of Qt's transition from proprietary to reciprocal to GPL licensing, a phenomenon I recently [explored on my personal blog](https://writing.kemitchell.com/2019/04/06/Stairway-to-Heaven.html).  Later in the same piece:

> When I first heard of the practice of selling exceptions, I asked myself whether the practice is ethical.  If someone buys an exception to embed a program in a larger proprietary program, he's doing something wrong (namely, making proprietary software).  Does it follow that the developer that sold the exception is doing something wrong too?

> If that implication were valid, it would also apply to releasing the same program under a noncopyleft free software license, such as the X11 license.  That also permits such embedding.  So either we have to conclude that it's wrong to release anything under the X11 license---a conclusion I find unacceptably extreme---or reject the implication. Using a noncopyleft license is weak, and usually an inferior choice, but it's not wrong.

I don't think condemnation of licenses like X11, better known as MIT, unacceptably extreme.  If the point is principle, picking a permissive license when copyleft would do is a clear offense.  Perhaps a venal sin, rather than a mortal one.  But a sin nonetheless.

License Zero, and the [Parity Public License](https://paritylicense.com) it stewards, strongly _encourage_ selling exceptions to copyleft.  licensezero.com is a platform for selling exceptions, and Parity is a strong copyleft license that _expects_ a single licensor in a unique position to do so.

If I don't accept Stallman's justification for selling exceptions, what's my line?

## Reward contribution to the copyleft network.

Copyleft encourages release of open software by two key mechanisms:

First, a wealth of existing, compatible copyleft software rewards the choice to release software into the open with automatic access to a wealth of other free software.  I've called this [copyleft's _network effect_](https://blog.licensezero.com/2018/05/13/commons-club.html#network).  The crux of the network effect is the accumulated utility of software available under copyleft terms.

Second, lots of copyleft projects, from lots of different kinds of developers, in the near and distant past, makes others comfortable releasing their own work.  Let's call this _social proof_.  Socialization depends not on the utility of software released, but the number and diversity of developers who release under copyleft terms, and succeed by it.

Note that I do _not_ mention license enforcement, political propaganda, attachment to key projects, or fear of ostracism from the open software community.  Those are at best secondary factors.  In my experience, they're closer to negligible.

Returning to selling exceptions:  How does that practice map onto copyleft's key mechanisms?

All releases of copyleft source code strengthen copyleft's network effect.  From the point of view of other open software developers, it doesn't matter if the developer sells exceptions to copyleft, what price they charge, or what terms they offer.  That deal structure simply doesn't matter for those building more open, rather than closed, work.

Selling exceptions similarly boosts copyleft social proof.  Individual activists have strong intrinsic motivation to release software under copyleft terms.  That isn't broadly true of business firms.  Every business firm selling exceptions to copyleft, and succeeding that way, builds the missing business case for copyleft.  Success creates case studies that pave the path to copyleft for more managers to follow.
