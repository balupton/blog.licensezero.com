There's a view of copyleft that goes something like this:

> Copyleft doesn't achieve anything for software freedom unless it applies to everyone the same, including the original developer of the software.  If only one company can build proprietary add-ons, or there's a company selling exceptions to copyleft to others, that's abuse copyleft as a business ploy, rather than for software freedom.

We see the same view reflected in the Free Software Foundation's [policy against selling exceptions to the GPL](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/selling-exceptions.en.html) for its own projects.  And we see it reflected in terms, like section 7 of [copyleft-next](https://github.com/copyleft-next/copyleft-next) version 0.3.1, a kind of scratchpad research license looking forward to the next General Public License:

> ## Nullification of Copyleft/Proprietary Dual Licensing
>
> If I offer to license, for a fee, a Covered Work under terms other than a license that is OSI-Approved or FSF-Free as of the release date of this License or a numbered version of copyleft-next released by the Copyleft-Next Project, then the license I grant You under section 1 is no longer subject to the [copyleft] conditions in sections 3 through 5.

License Zero, and the [Parity Public License](https://paritylicense.com) it stewards, obviously disagree.  licensezero.com is a platform for dual licensing.  The Parity Public License _expects_ a single licensor with superpowers, and works great with licensezero.com.

Does that make License Zero an outlier?  Not so fast.  Dig around fsf.org long enough, and you'll also find that RMS also obviously disagrees, too.  To [quote him](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/selling-exceptions.en.html):

> I've considered selling exceptions acceptable since the 1990s, and on occasion I've suggested it to companies.  Sometimes this approach has made it possible for important programs to become free software.

RMS goes on to give the example of Qt's transition from proprietary to restricted to GPL, a phenomenon I [recently explored on my personal blog](https://writing.kemitchell.com/2019/04/06/Stairway-to-Heaven.html).  Later in the same piece:

> When I first heard of the practice of selling exceptions, I asked myself whether the practice is ethical.  If someone buys an exception to embed a program in a larger proprietary program, he's doing something wrong (namely, making proprietary software).  Does it follow that the developer that sold the exception is doing something wrong too?

> If that implication were valid, it would also apply to releasing the same program under a noncopyleft free software license, such as the X11 license.  That also permits such embedding.  So either we have to conclude that it's wrong to release anything under the X11 license---a conclusion I find unacceptably extreme---or reject the implication. Using a noncopyleft license is weak, and usually an inferior choice, but it's not wrong.

I don't find condemnation of licenses like X11, better known as MIT, unacceptably extreme.  If the point is principle, picking a permissive license when copyleft would do is a condemnable offense.  Perhaps a venal sin, rather than a mortal one.

But if I don't follow Stallman's line on selling exceptions, what's my justification?

## Reward contribution to the copyleft network.



## No single project compares to the network.

Not even Linux.

## Carrots, not sticks.

...

## Business failure is normal, and no loss.
