In [_Money, Money, Money --- Writing software, in a rich (wo)man's world_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mY8B2lXIu6g), Django core team member and Django foundation head Russell Keith-Magee:

- confronted the need for money to fund free software

- talked through the problems of popularized business models

- touched on dual licensing as a model without common drawbacks

- noted issues peculiar to small projects

- floatsed the radical idea of a distribution system that makes paying package developers, and package dependencies' developers, easy

The talk appears to date back to 2015, the same year I began work on License Zero.  I watched through for the first time today.
