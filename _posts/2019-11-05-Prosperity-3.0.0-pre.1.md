title: Prosperity 3.0.0-pre.1
description: bringing Prosperity up to par with Parity
---

I've begun redrafting License Zero's noncommercial-license option, the [Prosperity Public License](https://prosperitylicense.com), to mirror recent style and substance improvements to [Parity 7](https://paritylicense.com/versions/7.0.0).

Prosperity 3 can also build on cutting-edge work on noncommercial terms in [Polyform Project](https://polyformproject.org)'s [Noncommercial](https://polyformproject.org/licenses/noncommercial/1.0.0/) and [Free Trial](https://polyformproject.org/licenses/free-trial/1.0.0/) terms.

As always, [work continues in the GitHub repo](https://github.com/licensezero/prosperity-public-license).
