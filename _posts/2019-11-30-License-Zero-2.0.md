title: License Zero 2.0

I am in the process of refreshing the design of License Zero.  My goals are:

1.  Support other agents and independent sellers.

2.  Streamline.

The upshot of the first is that developers should be able to run `licensezero buy` to buy licenses not just through licensezero.com, but also through other servers affording the same API.  Some of those APIs may be run by individual developers selling private licenses for their own work, either because they can't get a Stripe account or just because.  For example, I'd like to see a server-in-a-box that handles private license sales with payment to a single dev via PayPal.
