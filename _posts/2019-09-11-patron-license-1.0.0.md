I'm pleased to announce [version 1.0.0 of the Patron License](https://patronlicense.com/versions/1.0.0.html), a standard license that allows creators to reward patrons on sites like Patreon, Open Collective, Liberapay, and now GitHub Sponsors with exceptions to the noncommercial or copyleft terms for their work.

Version 1.0.0 comes about with feedback from several other wonderful people, including software developers who [used preview releases "in the wild"](https://blog.licensezero.com/2019/09/02/zkat-system.html).  Some of that feedback has led to points on the roadmap for future development, like [multi-seat site licenses for organization sponsors](https://github.com/licensezero/patron-license/issues/3).  You can follow development [on GitHub](https://github.com/licensezero/patron-license).

The Patron License was [announced here on the blog](https://blog.licensezero.com/2019/05/24/patron-license.html) in May.
