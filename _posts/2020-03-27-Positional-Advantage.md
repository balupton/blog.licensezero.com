title: Licensing or Service Advantage
description: why not both?
---

I heartily recommend folks running or considering public-private licensing business plays to [read Dirk Riehle's post on comparative and positional advantages](https://dirkriehle.com/2018/10/23/some-argue-that-dual-licensing-in-commercial-open-source-indicates-a-lack-of-ability-to-provide-superior-service/).  As a teaser sample:

> So, if someone says that using a dual-licensing strategy indicates a lack of ability to provide superior service, it is obviously a tease to give up an important positional advantage.  The smart CEO will ignore it.

In typical Dirk fashion, he then goes on to address some situations where giving up positional advantage---your singular ability to license the software two ways---might make sense.

Short, sweet, and very much worth the read.
