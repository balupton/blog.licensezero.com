The License Zero Reciprocal Public License, which became [Parity](https://paritylicense.com), was the first public software license to meet my personal standards of brevity and readability.  Since then, more have followed, including the [Blue Oak Model License](https://blueoakcouncil.org/license/1.0.0), [Polyform Project licenses](https://polyformproject.org/licenses), the latest draft of the [Cryptographic Autonomy License](https://github.com/holochain/cryptographic-autonomy-license), and my own [API Copyleft License](https://github.com/kemitchell/api-copyleft-license).

Each of those licenses took at least partial inspiration from Parity's style.  Each of those licenses has put more eyeballs---lawyers' and hackers'---on the rudiments of public software licensing since.  In version 7.0.0, Parity will take a few lessons from the licenses it inspired.

The first preview of Parity 7.0.0 follows.  It's a bit longer than Parity 6.0.0, but also much easier to read.  Have a read for yourself.

This new work would not have happened, or been possible, without the interest and support of many new users.  Special thanks are due to Kat MarchÃ¡n, Markus Binsteiner, Daniel Compton, Casey Kuhlman, and Han Seoul-Oh.  I'm sure I'm forgetting others.

Development continues.  Please feel free to send issues and pull requests to [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/licensezero/parity-public-license), which is more active today than it's ever been before.

>
> ## Contributing
>
> When this license requires you to contribute:
>
> 1.  Publish all source code, in the preferred form for making changes, through a freely accessible distribution system widely used for similar source code, so the contributors and others can find and copy it.
>
> 2.  Ensure that each part of that source code is available to the public under a license at least as permissive as this one, such as MIT, two-clause BSD license, Apache 2.0, Charity 3.0.0, or Blue Oak Model 1.0.0.
>
> 3.  Take these steps within thirty calendar days of when you first did anything requiring contribution.
>
> Note that this license does _not_ allow you to change the license terms for this software, but only to contribute software covered by [Copyleft](#copyleft) under qualifying licenses.
>
> ## Excuse
>
> You are excused for unknowingly breaking [Copyleft](#copyleft) if you contribute as required, or stop doing anything requiring this license, within thirty days of learning you broke the rule.
>
> ## No Liability
>
> ***As far as the law allows, this software comes as is, without any warranty or condition, and the contributor will not be liable to anyone for any damages related to this software or this license, under any kind of legal claim.***
