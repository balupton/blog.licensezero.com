Proposal:

- Suspend development on the License Zero command-line interface.  Sell licenses exclusively through licensezero.com's web interface.  Revisit when when people are complaining that buying so many L0 licenses is painful.

- Reallocate time spent making it easy to buy a lot of licenses at once to maximizing licenses bought for each individual L0 project.  Focus on business, marketing, and developer networking support.

- Reintroduce support for different licensing models, like site/company/multi-user licensing, at developer's choice.
