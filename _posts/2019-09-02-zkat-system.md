Kat Marchán, longtime contributor to the npm CLI and early Rustacean, published ["A System for Sustainable FOSS"](https://dev.to/zkat/a-system-for-sustainable-foss-11k9), which outlines her new approach to developer tools.  Kat recommends the [Parity license](https://paritylicense.com), the [Patron License](https://blog.licensezero.com/2019/05/24/patron-license.html) first announced here on this blog, and optionally [License Zero](https://licensezero.com) for additional licensing.

I could not be more happy to see cutting-edge dev tool developers turning to License Zero tools to support their work!
