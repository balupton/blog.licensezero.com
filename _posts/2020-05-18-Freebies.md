title: Freebies
description: unifying private licenses and waivers
---

licensezero.com has just been updated to sell licenses on new version 8.0.0 of the private license form.  The CLI has also been updated, replacing the `licensezero waiver` subcommand with `licensezero freebie`.

Rather than deal with two different legal forms, one for private licenses and one for waivers, everything happens on one form.  A freebie is just a private license with a price of $0 and an optional term limit.
