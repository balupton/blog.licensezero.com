title: Public Roadmap
description: a website for ongoing and upcoming efforts

I've published [roadmap.licensezero.com](https://roadmap.licensezero.com) to surface more information on my current and upcoming efforts around License Zero's websites, API, CLI, and documentation.

This remains a mostly personal roadmap for my own effort.  License Zero now enjoys more users sending feedback than I can keep up with.  But it's still my firm belief that the project benefits, rather than suffers, from disciplined economy of motion.

The last thing I want to do is turn the roadmap into an object of governance politics, or to do work on the project for the sake of doing work.  Limits on available time---externally imposed and self-imposed---have been key to keeping License Zero conceptually coherent so far.

License Zero's building blocks interact with a lot of complex systems: the law, development practice, market expectations, and so on.  A system interfacing with that kind of complexity can be simple or it can be bad.  License Zero will be as simple as possible.  But it will also change.  I want to give License Zero developers as much comfort as I can that change is a conscious process, with broad opportunity to feed back.
