The new [Patron License](https://github.com/licensezero/patron-license) enables developers to tunnel the [public-private licensing business model](https://indieopensource.com/public-private/indies) through  funding platforms that support "perks", like Patreon, Open Collective, and now GitHub Sponsors.

Permission to ignore a noncommercial or copyleft license rule becomes a perk.  But instead of "nice to have", it's "have to have".  Which I trust will help to rectify the disappointing financial results we've seen from such platforms, setting aside [a handful of highly publicized outliers](https://reference.kemitchell.com/top-donations-developers.html), many of whom tunnel advertising through patronage.

Structurally, the overall effect differs a bit from [licensezero.com](https://licensezero.com).  Would-be commercial users and closed-source developers pay a developer or a group, rather than per project.  If they reach the relevant perk tier, their patronage entitles them to licenses for all the projects linked to that fundraising campaign via the Patron License.

The Patron License also implements subscription licensing, or recurring revenue, rather than one-off payments.  This is possible, and convenient, because the underlying fundraising platforms handle those mechanics.  The license need only say that you have to stay a sponsor at a qualifying tier to keep the license.

The license text is based on the [Blue Oak Model License](https://blueoakcouncil.org/license/1.0.0) and License Zero's own [form private license](https://licensezero.com/licenses/private).  If you're looking to skim, read through [Applications](#applications) and stop.  The rest is more or less Blue Oak.
